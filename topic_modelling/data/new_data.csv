description
"40% of the work scope could only be completed under possession of all lines. At tender stage, no full investigation into possession opportunities was made and assumptions on possession and Line Block availability proved to be completely inaccurate. Consequently, possession works programmed to take 1 week (5 x 10hr shifts = 50hrs) actually took 10 weeks (10 x Sat Night x 5hrs = 50 hrs.). With three separate subcontractors requiring overlapping access, this compounded the delay and work items priced at tender stage to be completed concurrently could only be completed as predecessor & successor. Again, these work items had the same possession restrictions as previously noted - multiplying item durations by a factor of 10. When all non-possession dependent works had been completed and only weekend possession work remained, additional inefficiencies were imported into the scheme: 1. No Supervision required on site during the week. Consequently, all supervisors and managers worked on other schemes Monday – Friday and therefore lost any kind of ownership of the scheme. Weekends became a routine and any investment in the effective delivery of the scheme was lost due to managers becoming more immersed in their weekday schemes. 2. Locality of the scheme meant that supervisors & specialist subcontractors had to travel for a minimum of 3 hours to reach the site because they no longer lodged at the location. They were tired when they arrived and Murphy were paying a minimum of two shifts to every person travelling to the site to complete a single 5-hour possession. 3. Larger Plant & Equipment had to be hired every Friday and off-hired on Mondays. This required supervision to be in attendance on Fridays and Mondays in addition to Saturday nights. Tender Duration: 20 weeks Actual Duration: 88 weeks equates to 68 weeks over-run less 4 weeks’ additional holidays (Christmas & Easter) = 64 weeks 40% of work scope required critical path weekend possessions: Equivalent to 8 weeks of mid-week 10hr day working: Apply multiplier for weekend working (WE possessions vs Mid-week 10hr working): 8 x 10 = 80 weeks. The additional 4 weeks (88 weeks less 84 weeks) can be attributed to the imported inefficiencies highlighted above. Steel Fabricators Lessons Learned Report is attached for reference. Exeter Central Access to harp units was only possible during weekend possessions or midweek line blocks during the day. These consisted of 5 minutes’ windows between trains and consequently work was extremely ineffective and 60% of every shift was lost moving to a position of safety and taking new blocks to facilitate the limited amount of time available on track. The tender was based on midweek possessions/line blocks; however, these were not available. Exeter signal box cited work load as the main reason for not agreeing LB applications.
Estimators and Pre-Construction Teams to ENSURE POSSESSION OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONFIRMED with the planner prior to developing the tender programme. Any ambiguity MUST be clarified via the tender TQ process.

"The compound license agreement expired and the compound was lost due to project over-run. A welfare van had to be used going forward and this did not provide facility to comfortably look at detailing and maintain the required office duties adequately. Method of Working Exeter Saint David’s Method of working at Exeter Saint David’s and Exeter Central is detailed in Programme & Progress above. Work was possession dependent and extensive methodology meetings were held to determine if alternative methods could be adopted to enable work to be completed out of possession. Conclusions were that previously agreed methodologies were the most appropriate for the works being undertaken. Lawrence Hill Footbridge replacement was completed by fabricating off site and lifting into position with a crane in possession. New quay Excavation of canopy foundations was poorly planned and executed. Temporary works had not been considered adequately prior to installation resulting in programme delay while temporary works design was prepared. Initial ideas for supporting excavations proved to be ineffective. Agreement was made with Network Rail to keep the station cafe open during the works where practical. This proved to be a mistake as the cafe owner was uncooperative and did not assist us in any way. The result was imported programme risk to the works and delays incurred from ensuring works were completed safely around customers and staff. Engineering Control Exeter Saint David’s Site Manager had limited experience of steel repairs resulting in lack of understanding of programme implications and design concerns ahead of engaging a specialist contractor. Similarly, the extent of steel repairs was vastly under-estimated by estimators. Cheapest steel price and most competitive programme used for bid at tender stage. Lack of technical expertise by project team and CRE checking steel TQs resulting in an over-reliance of external design consultants to progress the works. New quay A number of engineers (agency and direct) visited site to complete setting out duties and errors were made in the positioning of holding down bolts and the detail for casting them into the foundations for the canopy steel frame support structure. Incorrect plates were used to cast into the foundation and this resulted in a non-conformance, additional pull out testing and a requirement to resin-anchor all bolts in position retrospectively.
As above for programme delay. Early liaison required between site manager and CRE to determine temporary works requirements. The temporary works register was maintained, but the CRE did not input into other potential requirements not listed until presented with a WPP for review. Early meetings at planning stage with SM & CRE to agree register of Temporary Works design requirements. Unless works can be completed without dependence on tenant’s cooperation, ensure franchises are closed for duration of the works. Ensure suitable CRE/Engineers are available to assist SMs & estimators when assessing steel repair durations and designs ahead of procuring a specialist subcontractor. During critical periods of setting out, ensure engineers are on site ahead of works to allow adequate time for them to familiarize themselves with the scheme and ensure they remain on site until activities requiring critical setting out have been completed.

"Very poor detailing on AFCs and lack of any ownership from Design Team. Very slow to respond to TQs to the extent that the site team lost all confidence in them. When comments were received they were poorly detailed and demonstrated little knowledge of the scheme. Even on site visits, there was an unwillingness to really understand the concerns of site personnel Very poor service and lack of ownership of any design. Limited resource availability in Bristol Office. Exeter Saint David’s Murphy CREs to look far more closely at buildability of steel repairs before signing off design proposals. Footbridges have individual steel members that can be extremely difficult to remove or repair for limited value and this is rarely picked up by design consultancies. All Schemes Design Co-ordinator Design co-ordination was completed independently from Project teams. There was a lack of link-up between construction teams and designers. This has subsequently been addressed by making the deign co-ordination role part of the project team role and responsibility. This step change has ‘forced’ earlier buy in to schemes from PMs previously predominantly focused on delivery. DO NOT USE BRISTOL OFFICE AGAIN Tim Cooney to investigate options for linking design deliverables to LDs. Early site visits advised for design team & liaison with construction team. Design review meeting proposed for future schemes with Consulting Engineers, Design Resource All Schemes AECOM Bristol office resource levels are very limited. Only one director responsible for signing off all designs and one engineer working on the package of schemes. Design Errors Exeter Central Designer identification of harp unit repairs was wholly inaccurate and was deemed to be close to negligent. OVER 50% OF HARP UNITS IDENTIFIED FOR REPAIR REQUIRED FURTHER WORK THAN SPECIFIED IN DESIGN DRAWINGS. Furthermore, approximately 30% more additional harp units were identified to be in need of repair not captured in the original design surveys. Murphy CEM/CRE involvement was very limited both during construction and design stages. Aecom response to Murphy concerns was poor. Suggested Actions. DO NOT USE BRISTOL OFFICE AGAIN Tim Cooney to investigate options for linking design deliverables to LDs. Early site visits advised for design team & liaison with construction team. Design review meeting proposed for future schemes with Consulting Engineers, Murphy Project Manager, Design Co-coordinator and CRE prior to issue of F001/F002 & later for F003. Design Co-ordinator to be a member of project team reporting to PM. Do Not Use Again As Above. DO NOT USE AECOM BRISTOL OFFICE."
Lack of communication between CRE and Site Teams resulted in slow delivery of temporary works. As for permanent works this issue has since been addressed by the structure change bringing the design co-ordination role into the Project Delivery Team. Link between Site Manager and Design Team was sometimes remote for temporary works and site manager notified designers that they were unhappy with elements of the design after design development. This resulted in creating urgent revisions that were completely avoidable. Designers to liaise with site teams prior to commencing design. Site managers to ensure that construction concerns are highlighted early in the process. Suggested Actions. CRE’s to become more involved in looking at potential issues ahead of works commencing and investing effort in reviewing designs for buildability. Site Managers to create register with CRE at project inception and ensure meetings are held well in advance of activity commencing.
"Adequate supervision was provided for the initial phase of the works when works could be completed in normal working hours. However, when works could only progress at weekends, supervisors stopped lodging and had to travel for a minimum of three hours from home to get to the site. Due to supervisors working on other contracts in the midlands these contracts then took priority with weekend working causing difficulties with getting continuity of representation at Exeter. New quay Agency Rail Site Manager chosen to manage the works had limited experience of excavations and civils works resulting in poor management of foundation works. All Other Schemes Adequate Supervision for Works was provided. Specialist Knowledge of Supervisors Exeter Saint David’s Lack of ownership attributed to the reasons above was evident and in addition, supervisors that were available to cover the weekend shifts were not sufficiently competent to understand the footbridge repair works. Murphy supervision was only capable of managing the works with due regard for safety and admin responsibilities. An understanding of the work scope was left to the specialist subcontractor. This put a burden of responsibility onto the subcontractor because the drawings were poor and detailing minimal. Murphy supervisors were unaware of the difficulties being encountered or how to resolve them and progress the works. They were also unaware if the subcontractor was working effectively or not. They could only assess that the subcontractor was ‘working’.For weekend only working, consider employing specialist supervisors local to the works on a temporary basis."
"Due to the distance from our Regional Office, external plant 
was used for the schemes. Standard of plant used was 
generally high and fitters were local.Using local suppliers, plant issues were resolved quickly."
Steel supplied for the bridges from Clifford Friend was incorrectly drilled and sized. None of the bottom plate steel had been template with a plastic or timber section. This was not identified by site staff and only referenced by Harrison Engineering following the determination of Clifford Friend’s contract. Some steel was missing and this was not identified by site teams. All other Schemes No Issues. GRNs Individuals failed to collect GRNs and send to accounts causing delays to payments of key suppliers and poor regional performance stats for issuing GRNs to accounts. Supervisors should check all materials delivered to site in accordance with Murphy procedure. All footbridge steel has a template made before drilling. All GRNs should be scanned to the server and sent to Golbourne weekly.
"High quality performance and assistance with contract completion. Final costs were excessive, but this was due to distance of Harrison personnel from the scheme location and access restrictions. This was understood at contract award and additional costs were not attributed to subcontractor profit. Contract taken on by Harrison after determination of Clifford Friend contract. Works only taken because Harrison are a preferred supplier and they wanted to assist Murphy to complete the scheme following a very negative experience with a local subcontractor. Clifford Friend - FB & Lift FB Steel Repairs Extremely Poor Performance. Limited resource available meant he was not able to meet Exeter Central Volker Laser Concrete Repairs to harp units. Good performance, but very commercially astute. Project Team and buyers should be aware that scope has to be clearly defined and adhered to. Lawrence Hill Harrison Engineering Stairs fabrication & Installation. New quay Fabric Architecture Fabric Canopy Small contractor with limited assets. Subcontract all install works and were contractually very poor. This resulted in difficulties on site whereby they were receiving change controls from their subcontractors that they looked to recover through Murphy. Recovery was not valid and they engaged a solicitor to look at the contract. Fabric Architecture had no basis for a claim and the variation was subsequently dropped. CDC Demolition of existing canopy and steel support structure Inadequate protection to working area when dismantling existing canopy. Network Rail requested that they were not used again on Network Rail Schemes. Refer to H&S below. Brannon Builders Cafe Alteration Works Very poor supervision and programme certainty. Small contractor with limited resource. Inappropriate for railway working. KEY LEARNING MURPHY HAVE A LIMITED DATABASE OF SUPPLIERS IN THE SOUTH WEST AND THEREFORE HAD TO USE UNPROVEN SMALL CONTRACTORS FOR DELIVERY OF MUCH OF THIS PACKAGE. WHERE SMALLER CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN USED, THEY HAVE PERFORMED POORLY AND CAUSED SIGNIFICANT SAFETY OR COMMERCIAL ISSUES. BUYERS TO LOOK AT AUDITING AND DEVELOPING A STRONGER SUPPLY BASE IN THE SOUTH WEST OR SENIOR MANAGERS TO REVIEW GEOGRAPHICAL REACH OF THE OFFICE. CONSIDER DECLINING WORK FURTHER SOUTH WEST THAN EXETER. Use Again Use again. Key Supplier/Partner for steel fabrication. DO NOT USE AGAIN Use again, but ensure PTI captures all scope requirements, programme and lead times. Use again. Key Supplier/Partner for steel fabrication. Do not use again due to amateur contract administration influencing their site decisions and progress. Do Not Use again. Do Not Use Again."
"Due to the access issues at Exeter and very poor design service from Aecom on all schemes, and particularly with the negligent design at Exeter Central, Network Rail programme managers had a negative perception of the scheme. Within Murphy, it was recognized that the tender did not reflect actual access availability and the project team were under recovering from the very beginning as a consequence. Through a number of key meetings with the Network delivery team, the individuals involved understood the reasons for programme delays, but this understanding did not extend to senior managers within Network Rail and consequently the package was not well received internally. Network Rail ‘suggested’ that any tenders received going forward that had AECOM design input would not be reviewed favorably. Murphy applied for all costs and time associated with design changes and access constraints. This was rejected by Network Rail on a number of occasions, but an agreement was reached within the contract period that made a fair assessment of the change and demonstrated some acceptance for the access constraints by Network Rail. The scheme absorbed a huge amount of the PM, estimators, QS’ time and in part (time) was completely avoidable had the track access been confirmed at tender stage. Ensure PM input into tender preparation, buildability and specialist subcontract programme are checked with competent personnel internally before using quotes or preparing programme. As previous for programme."
Quality Issues referenced in Subcontract and Design Sections. NCRs Raised as appropriate.
"Demolition Contractor (CDC) had heras fencing set up around the station to prevent unauthorized access. However, when dismantling the existing canopy, a sheet of glass fell from the roof area and slid into the heras fencing causing it to shatter. The shattered glass hit a taxi cab parked adjacent to the fencing. The segregation zone was clearly not large enough for the works being completed. Brannon Builders had an operative put his foot through the ceiling of the operational cafe when working on the roof. An area of the roof had been subject to extensive weathering that was not identified prior to work starting. A combination of poor assessment planning by the site personnel before the activity commenced and a local building company being utilized that did not apply the same H&S rigor to their works as would be expected, were deemed to be the root causes. Supervisor was too accommodating with local business community. Learning is to ensure exclusion or working zones are adequate for the task being undertaken. This remains true under pressure from te local community to maintain normal working conditions while the construction works are progressing. As above. The cafe should have been shut and the roof could have been accessed from below. Small builders with insufficient capability to work on larger schemes. Do not use for rail work."
No environmental incidents recorded SWMP Site team encountered difficulties inputting into smart waste because Suppliers were not being updated into the system by the administrator. Tim Legg to discuss timely updating with administrator and determine why there is such a time lag from request to implementation. Post Meeting Note: P&T have improved database entries.
1. Estimators and pre-construction Manager did not confirm possession or LB opportunities with rail planner and consequently the tender programme was unachievable 2. Site Managers used to supervise activities they were not experienced in or suitably competent to drive technical or productivity efficiencies 3. Lack of Proven supply partners in the region. 4. Lack of competent supervisors in the region. See above for follow up recommendations.
"Programme slippage due to a variety of issues: Delays to electrical design Buried services diversions Internal Flooring quality issues Sign off for the 278 Works 3rd party contractors. Electrical design works by Capita Symonds was extremely late, leading to delays The buried services diversions to the new short stay carpark were late due to late client instruction despite being warned of timescales well in advance of JML attending site. The extent of works to the anti-terrorist bollards and foundations to the concourse area to the front of the station was greater than had been planned/ programmed. Information to be fed back to Estimator. The sign off for the 278 Works should have a more robust trail of e-mails following on site visits and agreements with different members of the Council highways division being involved at different stages of the works. Better management of the internal flooring contractor to ensure that substandard works are not overlooked and allowed to leave site. 3rd Party contractors employed by London midland and HCC delayed part of the works to the ticket vending machines and waiting shelters. At one point there were too many interfaces to manage efficiently - with AMT, W H Smith, HCC, Clear Channel, Optyma, RSL, Thales, Chubb and BT with little input or management from their management or the Client."
"Design issue from Capita Symonds was slow. The design of the security bollards foundations in particular, together with the M&E elements (which JMS had to get the subcontractor to complete) was very slow. Discussions should have been held with Capita Symonds earlier in the project with regards to this item and others in general. A TQ process was in place for the Civils and responses were received however mostly referred to approvals by client of suppliers and responses always required chasing and were received late."
Poor performance of Capita Symonds due to under resourcing of their staff. Better monitoring of the design as it progressed. More time allocated to review the performance of Capita Symonds on a regular basis.
"JMS labour and plant was used for the majority civils external works. With a team of seven men. Sub contract packages included electrical, curtain walling and entrance doors, suspended ceiling, Terrazzo flooring, block paving and surfacing. Agency labour was used in addition to JMS labour at times to increase resources and meet mile stone dates and accommodate additional works. Agency labour was also used to carry out more specialised works including the internal cladding as no sub-contractor would price. JMS also included plant and labour packages for the block paving for cost savings."
Replacement of plant without discussions with site. Poor plant from Speedy Hire whereas better quality plant from local supplier was available. Site felt the support from the P & T department was poor. Better management from P&T was required with regards to follow up discussions with site once plant had failed. Ongoing issues with Speedy Hire meant site requested other suppliers - however still received poor equipment from Speedy throughout.
Procurement of materials was sometimes slow and the information from Procurement Department changed. More face to face reviews between site manager and the procurement manager would have assisted. Perhaps the procurement manager could have attended every other project review on site? Procurement in general was good considering the volumes and range of materials and long lead items Savings were made on the block paving by use of approved alternative suppliers.
Rock Ceramics (floor tiling). Rock ceramics are a specialist contractor who generally worked well. They have had a few financial issues that required JMS to help. But that also affected their performance on site.
"The issuing of the Early Warning Notices (EWN’s) was handled well by the team. However, compensation events were not agreed by the client in the timely manner required under the contract. Main delays to the works were the existing buried services running through the bell mouth of the car park within phase 1 works. Delays were encountered throughout the works and notified to the client through EWN. These included delays to commencing works in specific areas due to WHSmith not vacating to agreed dates and approval of the S278 works Existing services were encountered throughout the works in each of the works areas. A claim is currently being worked up in regards to the non-agreement of compensation register on the scheme by London Midland."
"The overall quality of finish on the project was good. The client was generally happy with the project. Good quality management on site with the team. However, the handing over of each work area was snagged a number of times by the client and after being put into public use."
There were areas of concern from the client that were raised: Internal fencing supports falling on to passengers. Plant & Tools left out in the public areas. Material left sticking out of fence lines. The heras fencing used to secure working areas caused problems during the works due to the debris netting and signage that was installed as insisted by the client. This was eventually removed as the fencing kept blowing over causing risk to the public. Traffic management was an issue on the site with the general public as parking areas and drop off areas were removed and relocated as part of the works and during the permanent works the bus station changed to buses only and was not adequately controlled by others (client) as agreed.
"We had a few issues whilst undertaking out of hours works externally but remained in regular contract with environmental health and carried out numerous letter drops. The works should have been agreed to be undertaken within a different sequence, by the client. An alternative access route to the car park could have been used to close the access road during the taxi rank works. Also the bus station should have been fully closed during the works as a good majority of the bus services were put on diversion to avoid entering the bus station. If the bus station had been out of use, then no out of hours working would have been required for the external works."
"Planning was correct with appropriate timescales. Kept to programme and where slipped, this was revised as how to accelerate. Programme was reduced by 2 weeks due to allowable timescale given by the Council for the road closure. This added additional pressure to timescales. RMF (Subcontractor) poor performance and took 2 weeks longer than expected due to lack of resources. Two distinct sections of work: Concrete and strengthening and GB&P. Work should have been split between two Site Managers who concentrated on each distinct section. Commercial - Cost impact Circa 60k (due to snagging post final works onsite)."
"Excellent site set up with ECO cabins. ECO cabins do need more plug sockets. Use of Speedy 3G system for internet access. Much faster and more reliable. EMJ system developed with designer rather than original concrete planks. Would have been quicker to remove all concrete planks and replace with EMJ system. This was driven by the Clients requirements. Would have been quicker to remove all concrete planks and replace with EMJ system. This was driven by the Clients requirements. Encapsulation was too large and should have been around the steelwork area only and not over all the scaffold, which included kentiledge area. This increased area that required cleaning. Commercial – Time impact only alongside existing works. Design developed to install crash deck beneath bridge deck to allow concrete panels during day Commercial – Time saving over original tendered programme. Scaffold design worked well for access (Lyndon Scaffold). Volume of encapsulation was provided to Plant department. There was a lack of this machinery available. We do not believe that the plant sent was correct for the works and was under powered. Commercial – Cost of delays circa 2k due to delays and poor working volumes in initial stages of work. Paint inspections were signed by ICORR Level 2 inspector, but was reliant on site Painters completing WFT and DFT tests due to workload. Regular site visits. Lack of knowledge on GB&P works."
"Anders Elite men were 50/50 whether we got good labour or not. RMF Labour were good, but need Supervision at all times. Anders Elite – Inexperienced COSS provided which caused incident with putting dets wrong side of protection. Commercial – Impact to JMS image with NWR. Time spent on a GB&P scheme prior to commencing work would have been a benefit. Time spent on a GB&P scheme prior to commencing work would have been a benefit. Site Supervisor (John Sullivan) worked very well as a constant supervision rather than then being moved to nights. Night Manager found it hard with 6 weeks of constant night works."
Normally just put in req to Plant Dept. Due to locality of local company a local agreement was set up. Cost of per ton should have been flagged up as it was not realized until QS questioned it. Plant companies had to be chased to pick up plant as it was on site for 4 weeks longer than required. Site team booked plant late and should have planned further in advance ready for works. All provided by Plant companies. Reactive to our needs getting equipment to site.
Site team was aware and ordered in good time. Grit to be stored in a container as when outside tends to sweat in bags and does not go through pot.
"Reacted well to small changes, but suffered with lack of resources. Didn’t resource sufficiently. Good. Did very well. The Foreman on site (Ian) was positive. Only gave their encapsulation company 2 days’ notice to come to site. They managed to get to site but there was a weak delay in completing both sides of scaffold."
Network Rail paid almost all claims submitted without question and went on Site visit with JMS QS to look at project to gain a better understanding Bitumen on underside of structure not identified at Tender stage and not queried. Commenced removal and found it very difficult. A TQ was raised to simply a braid and apply further coat of bitumen over the top which was agreed. We had lost 3 weeks of working time by this point. Designers were already involved in the scheme with NR prior to JMS involvement. No PTI minutes were written for the contract agreement with the designer.
Identified and completed by Site Engineer (Paul O’Conner). Completed by Painters and Site Manager. Could have had more visits by ICORR lvl2 Inspectors. Clean air test was missed on north side of structure.
CLAW regulations briefings would have been of benefit prior to commencing works.
Due to land access issues out of our control progress was slow and the programme constantly required updating Over 20 programmes were produced and these could only be updated by the planner using P6. Microsoft Project to be utilized due to ease of use and accessibility Although numerous programmes were produced less than five were accepted by the client.
"JMS E,C & I commissioning engineer had experience and a positive relationship with both client and subcontractors. Pressure testing of pipelines with pressures of up to 325 barg within a live gas processing plant. Welding excavating and installing pipe work that affected numerous land/asset owners and the restrictions this created – these included ConocoPhillips, BOC, TATA, Sembcorp, BP, Northumbrian Water, Sabic, PD Tee sport, GDF Suez, Akzo Nobel. Potential large risk on the project mitigated by using a suitably qualified employee. Pressure testing of pipelines with pressures of up to 325 barg within a live gas processing plant Protection measures and paper work planned and submitted early to provide the client with adequate lead in time and the testing was completed successful. Adaptable and experienced Construction team adhered to the various restrictions imposed and the installation of the pipe line passed without any major incidents or lost time accidents."
Proximity of designers caused problems with our management of them. RFI requests to the client generally feedback was slow. Novation and design of valve order. HDD and Sleeve Requirement due to existing concrete structures. Engage local more accessible designers or confirm regular attendance required on site within the sub contract. Track and pursue the client’s responses more thoroughly Often responses were made by individuals and were not the shared/agreed position of the client’s team Better management of the client in future to ensure a clear and timely formal response. JMS were expected to novate an existing valve order Full visibility of the status of the order and the design of the valves was not available. Due to this JMS did not novate the order and ultimately the valves became free issue from the client This decision proved correct as the client had several issues with the valves that increased costs and caused delay to the project. As part of the HDD design/survey JMS encountered existing concrete foundations to plant owned by Northumbrian Water adjacent to the launch pit to allow the HDD to proceed a concrete sleeve was installed prior to the HDD at the launch pit site This minimized the risk to these existing foundations This was installed successfully prior to the HDD and enable this high risk activity to be completed successfully.
Due to the repetition of the criteria for the permit to load/strike on larger work fronts i.e. trench boxes at each tie in weld point the paper work repeated itself. Installation of large temporary works packages for excavations from 3m – 13m in depth. Look at a typical permit to load/strike where the ground conditions are constant and appoint/train more temporary works supervisors to sign off at the work fronts. Temporary works designs included installation procedure this was followed and recorded as per the procedures and records showed we had no incidents Experienced JMS operatives working well under experienced supervision.
Due to the extended and varied activities within the project there was a large turnover of resources. Provision of a full time CAD operator. HSQE Provided prompt and quality training for new and existing employees and the level of supervision and team work meant we had no HR related incidents or issues Existing employees with previous experience were utilized whenever available/feasible from within the Murphy Group. The project required and benefitted from a full time CAD operator Additional to the Asbuilts he was essential for drawings/sketches relating to RAMS etc. and the client’s constant requests/instructions for details/assistance.
P&T provided the project with a full time fitter that proved invaluable throughout the project All operatives encouraged to follow procedures and report defects immediately Two-way communication with P&T throughout to try and limit the use of external plant. Due to the nature of the project and the access issues affecting the programme it was difficult to accurately plan for external plant hire durations in future projects consider the commercial sense of purchasing items expected to be on hire for long periods. Although some internal transfer notes were completed site operatives were made aware of their importance .This needs to be re affirmed for future projects.
Due to the varied location of the work fronts there were times when low stock was not identified early enough Need better communication and management of stores/store men – Overall Materials Controller. Were identified and expedited well throughout the project in liaison with designers and the QA department. Considering the numerous changes in design the site team in conjunction with the buying department provided materials in a timely manner. Due to the issues on site with the valves it highlighted the need to confirm that all ordered materials are fit for purpose and conform to the designers and required specifications This need to be confirmed with the provision and inspection of all necessary certification prior to acceptance. When ordering gaskets on the designer’s materials take off sheets the same number of gaskets should be purchased to allow for replacement after testing.
Sub-contractor LMR in conjunction with JMS fabricated drilled and installed the HDD as per the agreed programme. As mentioned in the design section a specialist sub-contractor installed a concrete sleeve prior to the HDD installation The equipment provided to carry out this installation required modification prior to use as it was deemed not fit for purpose by the permit issuers Sembcorp However the improvements required were managed and supervised by both LMR and JMS to allow a successful installation.
"Weekly progress and commercial meetings were carried out and detailed minutes were submitted to the client for review/comment usually within 2-3 days. Regular QS visits to site along with site diaries provided accurate site records. These were communicated to the client in weekly plant lists & weekly activity programmes/look ahead. Over 400 Early warnings were issued and followed up with relevant CE’s as required these were discussed and agreed in the weekly commercial meetings. Monthly reports containing the full commercial status, H&S stats, communication logs and latest progress/programme updates were issued. Had an open working relationship with the client however some verbal assurances some of which are in agreed minutes have been ignored/forgotten."
Standard of prep. on painting which was resolved and closed out. Quality of backfill material which was replaced and closed out. Quantity of NCR’s insufficient encourage the completion on a weekly to a minimum of monthly basis. Inspectors at the various work fronts performed as required however a dedicated full time materials controller would have benefitted the projects delivery. Welded over 2500 welds with repairs at less than 1%.
"Welfare facilities and the layout at the three site compounds have been commended by the client. In over 350,000 man hours worked by JMS on the project there have been no lost time accidents. Separate Traffic Management Plans were developed for each landowner. These were agreed implemented and adhered too throughout the project."
Excavated and installed next to and below the River Tees and a large water course within TATA without incident Following the guidelines set out in the Environmental Plan and RAMS.Controlling Ground Water - Location and monitoring of the discharge of ground water was a major concern to all landowners given the location and potential pollution issues.  No environmental issues as regular sampling was carried out and pumping locations and controls agreed with the landowners.
Programme agreed with NACAP. Good communication between PM’s.
Lifting plan was produced well in advance of the delivery dates – Client approved in good time. Condition of the bog mats deteriorated rapidly due to weathering and trafficking JMS to inspect more frequently.
Experienced and trained drivers used for transportation.
Due to trafficking bogmats were damaged and could not be reused Suggest in future damage/replacement % should be allowed for in hire rate.
Delivered on time meeting client’s key dates for shutdowns and commissioning.Location of work within AGI’s allows work to continue in less than clement weather.
Off-site fabrication in Leeds yard facilitated excellent QA arrangements and assisted in control of client issued materials.Painting is by nature the final activity and in this instance ran in to the winter period with weather obviously affecting progress. Allowance needs to be made for tents/heaters or if the client allows to defer until the following spring.
Poor financial result on 2011 projects. Feedback to estimating team to check project resources as a whole and not summation of activities as the ‘team’ in practice generally remains constant and is not subject to peaks and troughs as the programme would suggest.An issue is the type of work being a series of mini-projects within the whole scheme and at many differing geographical locations. It was challenging to supervise and co-ordinate resources.
Expense of transporting plant and materials to and from site. Better co-ordination required with P&T department to maximize economies in transport costs.
"Works carried out at various locations throughout England (Lancashire to Essex) were multi-disciplined (civil, mechanical, E&I) and involved working for three different NG project management teams with good feedback from all."
Repeat business from valued client – Working on these projects retains JMS profile with National Grid. Whist there has been a poor return this year we are currently in fifth year with this type of work and to date have turned over £3.5 million with an overall profit of £135 K to date after overhead. 
Delivered on time meeting client’s key dates for shutdowns and commissioning.
"HDD exited in incorrect position which led to delay and additional cost. The problem was tripartite between the Client MJL, Sub-contractor O’Connor and JMS. 1) MJL proposed line within width of their agreed easement was unfeasible. 2) JMS did not raise at tender stage 3) O’Connor did not raise at SC letting as result, whilst O’Connor stood their costs and MJL extended the easement JMS did not recover the costs of approximately 17 days delay and additional fabrication works to align the pipe. This had a detrimental effect on the financial result. It is imperative that due consideration is given to feasibility of Client’s design and easement issues especially where JMS are dependent on SC performance. Involve the SC earlier and transfer risk."
Expense of transporting plant and materials to and from site. Better co-ordination required with P&T department to maximize economies in transport costs.
HDD sub-contractor had excellent standard of equipment.
"Good relationships with landowner which facilitated relaxations on access.Good relationship with parish council and local populace, including donating Christmas Tree, reducing third party complaints to zero."
Greystar operate the pipeline on behalf of MJL and were aware of the above. JMS performance may skew their judgement should future become available from them.Reinstatement works required remedial measures although in mitigation the areas concerned was an extremely wet area immediately adjacent the SSSI.
Late award to suit NGN requirement pushed programme back to a late summer start whilst retaining early key date for completion of bypass. This and effect of winter working comprised JMS working efficiently. Always consider programme and consequential effect on time and money when negotiating with Client post tender / pre-award. Do not be too willing to meet their aspirations at the detriment of JMS. N.B. In mitigation. On this contract decision made to work with ‘new’ NGN management team with a view to continuing securing further works with this valued client. This was raised a risk in the risk / ops register at the time of tendering.
NGN sought to value engineer the works seeking cost savings due to their budgetary constraints. JMS acquiesced to this and possible areas of saving were discussed pre-award. However significant redesign was required was led to additional cost reducing the anticipated saving. When approached by Client regarding cost savings consider all consequential cost prior to discussing value of anticipated savings: • Design responsibility • Design costs including checking • Effect of programme • Other contracted work • Availability of SC & material resources.
Project award coincided with numerous other projects which put pressure providing adequate levels of supervision and labour for the project. Monitor future workload to identify potential pressures on resources and ensure that experienced supervision / labour is spread equally between projects especially with Project Management and other supervision.
Due to other awards P&T were unable to provide JMS plant initially leading to additional cost in ‘on/off’ charges. When third party plant crossed hired consider length of remaining hire – 2/3 weeks could be less that ‘on/off’ charge for JMS plant.
Client supplied materials – still awaiting certificates due to NGN paperwork issues. JMS insisted that issue of Completion Certificate was not compromised due client issues and first half retention released - Note for future projects.
"Testing, Radiography and Phased Array – Client inspection very poor and lacked leadership. Note that client’s obligations do not end at design and access to site- Pursue CE if they fail in their obligations in any area most importantly those that cost JMS time and money."
Level of resource - As noted above workload constraints led to the Project Manager having to be supported by inexperienced staff. As Resources comment above.
As built documentation – still awaiting certification for Client supplied materials. Numerous audits were carried out by NGN and JMS with very positive results.
Welfare facilities and Compound Set up. Audit results were very positive and there were no incidents on site.
Himalayan Balsam on site Landscape design specified ash trees effected by ash die-back. Identified and dealt with. Oak trees specified after discussion with NGN.
Identification of Best Practice. Storage boxes for chains.
Delivered on time meeting client’s key dates for shutdowns and commissioning.Project award coincided with numerous other projects which put pressure providing adequate levels of supervision and labour for the project. Accelerated at JMS cost to meet programme and reduce LD liability. 
JMS method of work removed need for demolition / rebuilding of existing RC culvert.
Issues with co-ordinating OS and Local Datum. Costs recovered as CE however issue carried over to handover documentation which had to be re-addressed for future development by third – party.
Compound constructed to NG Tier 1 standards – not a requirement of contract.
Poor financial result – under estimated resources and time.
Hot Tap work by NG Amber gate – Poor equipment (noise levels) and attitude to safety and PPE. This was addressed with Amber gate and improvement has been seen in later projects.
Client score excellent – First time we had worked for is particular NG manager from whom we now receive regular tender enquiries.Off-site fabrication in Leeds yard facilitated excellent QA arrangements and assisted in control of client issued materials.
Accident Free – 100% record.
Contaminated water issue resolved under JMS environmental testing regime.
Progress was slow in places due to ground conditions Unforeseen obstacles underground including old Tram Lines. A live Culvert was discovered at the beginning of the works (not on any drawings) These could not have been foreseen with Trail Holes. The Programme came in on Date.
Full Time Welding Inspector on site (SPI) No commissioning – Pipe left charged with dry air.
Design change as works progressed due to large number of services. Although we came across a number of Cables there were no Strikes & no Service Strikes. L/L – One of the Lessons Learned was we used Low-k8 Utilities Ltd Which is a radar scanning service.
Herras fencing / Traffic Management used to protect Workforce from live traffic Crowd barriers were used to protect pedestrians.
Due to Rotherham Council enforcing 7 day working from start to finish of the works. Resources was required for approx. 18 weeks – 7 days a week We had to spell the workforce due to fatigue L/L had to take Fatigue Policy into consideration.
"All Pipes supplied by Client prior to works commencing. All fittings act on time, no delays."
Corrpro – see Quality PTS – Testing Welders Full time SPI (Welding Inspector).
Tata Steel CCI Conditions Issue with Variations as these were subject additional Purchase Orders. Need to be aware on future projects as delay can occur in Timely Payments.
"Faulty CP Anodes, found when tested, changed Passed testing. 1 NCR was raised for using old Anode CP bags."
The Site was very restricted by Rotherham Council – maximum working width was only 3.0mts with less in places.
With over 30 years’ experience in Street works and excavations in the highway. There has always been Defects in the highway by the Local Councils. JM asked Rotherham Council if we could use Foam Concrete on Don caster Road (A630) due to it being a very Highly Trafficated Road. The Cost was offset by using 0.5 of Foam Concrete & 100mm Tarmac against 350mm of Tarmac & MOT Type 1 The finished product was a permanent job (no defects) Defects are usually charged at £80-£100 + labour & materials to repair.
"Unachievable programme given to client based upon very “loose” works information provided by the client. Despite this fact the original programme which was issued to the client was had the end date of February which was an achievable date. We were then asked to shorten the programme to suit the client’s financial targets which was done however this made the work simply impossible. Unachievable programme given to client based upon very “loose” works information provided by the client. Progress was slow. Reactive Nature. Despite this fact the original programme which was issued to the client was had the end date of February which was an achievable date. We were then asked to shorten the programme to suit the client’s financial targets which was done however this made the work simply impossible. In addition to the programme problems the amount of work that changed the work scope via PMIs and verbal instructions meant the work became extremely disjointed. Unfortunately, due to the lack of response from the client progress was very slow on site at times waiting for answers from the client. Positive side of things was when certain areas of work were released there was a positive reaction from the site team to get the work done and finished."
The site set up on both AGI complexes were extremely tight quarters with very little room to set up the cabins however thanks to the site staff a functional set up was produced successfully.
Temporary works were updated regularly on site with nothing being higher than a category 1.
"Unfortunately, due to the state of affairs regarding projects at the end it was not possible to re-allocate resources to other jobs as such the project incurred additional costs not originally forecast."
Plant and Transport Department supplied all plant exactly as requested and were able to deal with short notice requests in-line with the ever changing scope of works.
Some lead times quoted on items were very vague and unrealistic for the time frame of the project. From a site perspective recognizing the need for materials a little sooner would have resulted in potential savings. Buying Department able to react to the sudden needs of site and being able to complete orders in short time periods.
All subcontractors used at both Elton and Cowpens Bewley were excellent in both their attitude to work and also their competency.
Due to the nature of the project it was extremely difficult to manage the project as the goalposts seemed to change daily and the frequency of the changes up until Christmas were even hourly. All aspects of the management team pulled together and helped everyone out in order to pull all the documentation together and complete the job as quickly as possible. Client requirements varied as mentioned above however our understanding of the contract was superior to the client and certainly helped substantiate many claims.
Handover Documents were put together throughout the contract and placed into the online network folder for all to be able to see. Completing the As[1]Builts was done and scanned so electronic and hard copies were produced for the client. From a management point of view the network folder should have been populated sooner.
Set up was designed carefully and managed effectively throughout the project. Site personnel adopted reverse parking only system on site despite the tight quarters which helped the running of the site. Attended site regularly and helped out with many different queries which resulted in agreeable solutions.
Programme including CEs built into the programme gave clear picture. Programme constraints for deep dig on road section. CEs built into regularly updated program which gave a clear picture of the state of affairs. Excellent work regarding installing fabrication under gas main and continuing safe works for 180m.
Engineer worked closely with all aspects of the workforce and developed a fantastic relationship and trust throughout. Helped mitigate issues and solved engineering problems prior to them developing.
Client issued construction issue drawings with incorrect IP co-ordinates these were not checked.  Temporary Works Design submissions late. Check setting out information prior to starting works .Did not fully understand NG would require independent checking of Temporary Works Designs prior to implementation.
Some materials were procured late. Procurement schedule would have helped with input from the entire site team.
Daily allocation sheets submitted and signed by site supervisor. Quantity surveyor should be consulted regarding hiring agency workers. Mitigated any arguments when it came to Compensation Events.
"Mechanical works were controlled well Good positive audits from National Grid, relay feedback to workforce and ask to continue"
Phased Array Subcontractor Tender allowance sufficient however schedule of cost components did not cover delay costs. Consider Tender clarification or increase in allowance.
Delayed due to nesting birds NG issue Ground conditions worse than expected (water) programme moved into winter working Land access issues. Positive Commercially .Negative for NG.
"IT Equipment delivered late to the contract and not working and not suitable. IT equipment to be checked prior to be released, deadlines were not met (6 weeks out for printers) had to buy a printer for the client. N.B Cannock were extremely helpful but let down by supply chain."
"Planner involved throughout project Delayed start additional resource required to complete. More detailed handover required from MIL - JMS More investment at front end i.e. Shared understanding of scope from procurement, commercial and production teams."
Sequencing of work planned successfully with BGE and SGN to incorporate their isolation dates. Daily liaison with the client to update and adjust the project programme was invaluable Actions were discussed agreed and written to avoid any confusion.
Original Design was not complete Constructability poor. RFI and TQ requests to the client feedback was slow or queries ignored. Design needed to be challenged and further clarification required at tender stage. Preparation and submission of TQ’s and RFI’s to be more detailed and we need to pursue the client’s responses more robustly.
Due to commitment elsewhere within the group suitable resources were not readily available. Resourced programme required. Management of JMS and our sub-contract resource requires additional focus and planning throughout all stages of the project.
Supports and the steelwork were late onto site Improved communication required between production team and buying department required.
Sub contract tender prices unrealistic. Procurement of subcontractors. Tender allowances for sub-contractors were low for insulation and E&I Tender build up was not clearly identified Making recovery difficult. Delayed improve communication procurement and delivery teams.
Communication between site and support team was poor. More involvement from senior management to encourage teamwork throughout the project.
Contaminated land encountered. Contained and disposed of successfully.
Time delay caused by positive buoyancy. Mitigated 3 weeks’ time delay on contract programme by welding longer sections and reducing tie-in welds.
Transposing a previous project team from a previous successfully completed National Grid Project. Initially criticized by the client for not enough labour on site. Understood client requirements and was able to deliver a second successful project. Project was correctly resourced; client’s expectations were too high.
"Change of personnel regarding Quantity Surveyors part way through contract. No monies allocated to National Grid Board Audit. Although demands of the company alter, as much continuity as possible of the core team is essential. After reviewing the information and accounts approx. £25k was spent on preparing for the board audit this should be accounted for in future projects."
Difficulty in procuring essential site establishment items at beginning of contract. National Grid procurement pack to be actioned the second tender is confirmed as being won to mitigate any delay (if need be order to Head Office).
Training matrix provided by Learning and Development team had contradictions to training records. Review training matrix prior to commencement date for personnel and L&D team to cross reference.
"IT requisitions for equipment were sent in on time prior to site setup yet still took over 4 weeks for a printer to arrive, 6 weeks for the client’s which was not as per specification required. IT to be involved earlier in the project i.e. Start-up meetings to fully understand requirements and understand the need for meeting deadlines."
"Good working relationship with client regarding paperwork and an open, honest approach to the works. Maintain this and continue to improve client relationships."
Managed phased array efficiently to make a profit Careful close management resulted in a profit for the project
Successfully delivered a project with no accidents / injuries. Project team were safe at all times and adhered to written RAMS and procedures.
Additional resource required to meet programme dates Programme was completed on time Rotation of resources was not as per the tender. Resource rotation to be agreed at tender stage and followed through at site level Additional resourcing required due to delays partly created by SGN.
PM left the business prior to project completion. Construction team and QS led the completion of the project in his absence.
"Initial QS was on site for 8 weeks and was replaced. CE and EWn’s missed at early stages. Expected to use part time H&S, QS and planning resource whilst in Scotland due to other business units predicted workload Resource requirement was higher than anticipated. Improved management and support of contingent workforce required. Consider location and assume worse case resource at tender stage."
Subcontract and materials procurement lacked the commercial input required during the initial stages of the contract however this did improve. Project was constructed during the time of transition to centralization. Site team built up a good relationship with procurement resource to resolve any issues.
"Printers not available, satellite installation not carried out on time. Client feedback regarding our IT is poor Early engagement needs to be acted upon."
SGN relationship could not have been improved on Overall score 10 – Client Feedback Commercial relationship vastly improved after a slow start. Discussed and resolved engineering issues as a project team SGN are commercially savvy client need to engage them earlier and stronger on any future projects.
Significantly under estimated requirement for inspection. Realistic levels of inspection discussed and agreed at tender stage.
Issue regarding the welding procedure and pup lengths at an installed road crossing Design drawing conflicted with specification. Risk reduction meeting held issue was discussed and resolved with action agreed by SGN and JMS.
Two very successful HSE visits on this project Positive response from SGN and HSE. Both site compounds were of a high standard. Continued focus on our H&S commitments. Allow 3 weeks minimum for site set ups.
"Liaison with JMS, SGN and AWPR successful. Methodology was developed to improve the effectiveness of the stopple pit excavation team. Methodology was developed to improve the effectiveness of the stopple pit excavation team. JMS took the lead in the liaison with AWPR look to continue this in future multi contractors project. Collaborative thinking kept the project on programme."
Completed two weeks ahead of programme. Site team carried out continual monitoring of progress and look ahead.
Delayed invoicing for temporary works. Internal communication to be improved.
Long lead items arrived ahead of time .Planned and early ordering of both materials and sub contracts.
As per below set up was larger than expected and in an inadequate space. Set out intelligently considering works area provided.
Delay in the installation of the satellite and printers of approx. 6 weeks. Provide desktop scanner/printer/copier to PM Communication between IT and site not effective.
HDD – installed on time and within budget. Early engagement with sub-contractor based on detailed tender quotes.
Route was changed on five occasions. In situ concrete slabs removed from scope and sleeve installed by the Main Contractor. Change control management managed well. Scope change was controlled via a commercial comparison between tender allowance and constructed.
Several best practices submitted and accepted. Encourage bright ideas and best practices.
Shared office accommodation promised at tender stage was not available. Stand-alone set ups to be priced at tender stage.
Despite numerous route changes no issues. Good understanding and communication between all site team.
"Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful. For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence."
One property not shown on drawing affected when decommissioning old main.
"Poor client drawings, had to request additional information."
In house resource was available for this job and worked well.
Winch breakdowns.
Better understanding of material requirements due to previous scheme knowledge.
Direct Labour used in this job.
"Estimate Price £31,032 Actual Sales £31,487."
The tendered production rates were more than the actual rates achieved. The Contract programme was not up dated on a regular basis. Estimators should discuss progress rates with gang’s / foreman familiar with duct installation works. It is a requirement of the NEC contract to update the programme monthly. This should be done whether the client asks for it or not.
Site set up was in an ideal location on the route. Initial proposed foreman was not suitable for the job and had to be changed early on in the project. Open discussions with landowners / councils at an early stage to give us plenty of time to get the best possible site establishment for a project. Construction foreman was changed and efficiency on site improved.
"ENATS specification sand was required for the project. This was not readily available near the job and samples from quarries had to be sent away for test which took 4 weeks to get results .To get samples tested costs considerable money, I would suggest that quarries are sourced with the correct specification sand prior to contract award or sufficient time is allowed from contract award to starting on site to get an approved supplier."
Sub contract labour was used with a loose contract. In house resources are always better than sub contract. It is easier to control quality of the work of internal staff. If sub-contractors have to be used make sure the contract is clear.
Incoming Inspection Stores Control Storage Stock Control Surplus / Wasted Materials. See Design above.
Trying to get in with a new client. Lack of understanding of the NEC contract. CEs not agreed until the contract end. The Contracts Manager insisted on making some of the day to day decisions from 200 miles away which had a detrimental effect on the contract. We didn’t enforce the contract enough in an effort to get in with this client and hopefully get future work. We as a project team did not have a good understanding of the NEC contract. We have since been on some NEC workshops and seminars to improve our knowledge. It is a very hard task to successfully achieve but we should aim to agree CEs in a timely manner through the life of the contract. Trust the ability of the project management team to deliver the project successfully.
Duct installation was not proven during installation which added 6 weeks to the end of the contract proving the route ahead of cable installation. The duct installation did not progress from joint bay to joint bay to meet client requirements. Set up a system whereby the installed ducts are proven at the end of each week.
The site establishment was made up of Murphy owned cabins and plant. This is commercially good as it is an internal transfer of funds. It is also free advertising for the company.
A landowner with a disused quarry made himself known to site and offered a free tip to help fill his quarry. All his paperwork and SEPA licenses were checked out by the Waste Department and everything was in order. The internal resources with the ability to impartially check legislation requirements and protect the companies interest and assist in cost savings is a great asset.
"Slow start at commencement of contract in early October 2011 due to extremely high levels of rainfall which caused the whole site to become water logged. Thereafter good progress was made up to Christmas 2011, which left the programme 5% behind target. The decision was taken to come back early in January ahead of the agreed restart date of late February / early March. Fortunately, no major rain fell during the next 8 weeks and this coupled with heavy frosts allowed the remaining construction works to be completed ahead of schedule. Cabling started as programmed, but some drums of cable arrived one week late (50t crane required to unload, 90t crane used - LA lowered bridge weight limited during cable delivery!). Cable pulling - in march 21kM of cable installed over 5.5 days by London Cable Team - includes delay when Murphy (?) winch broke down. Site demobilized and awaited arrival of Jointers who arrived on the 12th April. All testing and commission works were completed by 1st June. Document handover certificate wait from Client. The number of parties required to undertake the various types of testing was reduced from 5No to 1No through the employment of own Murphy Test Engineer (Miles Stephenson). Site clearance and demobilization occurred on 21st June 2012. Murphy mobile unit was left on site until end of June. Murphy representative to be left on site to advise BBUL of cable and earth mat positions. J.Murphy turning circles & slope No benefit gained."
Earlier consideration needs to be given to laying off cable prior to vertical. installation within scaffolding and onto sealing end platform. Permit System – Murphy - Cable Pulling methodology was changed on site without recourse to designer who calculated the associated pulling tensions. The could have comprised the cable’s integrity and had pulling tensions been exceeded caused significant reputation damage CBS - see comments in material section below.
need to be involved in the design of Scaffolding Scaffolding - 4-hour emergency return to service wasn’t considered (ERTs plan development). Client - SSE’s Technical Department praised the performance of Rory Davidson (Murphy Designer) and asked that he be thanked for his efforts. Murphy - Due to other pressing work commitments it was not always possible to obtain the services of Rory Davidson when required. This left us vulnerable to programme delays / timely placement of orders.
"Suggest that Client authorization requirements are determined in advance of works commencing for direct and subcontract labour / services. Murphy - Due to the remote geographical location of forthcoming schemes it is likely that we will need to book test wagons for two / three days at a time. Estimators need to be informed to make allowance for same. Murphy - Access to the towers for testing - Scaffold was removed before we could test and access was via a mobile platform, whilst we had very little option to do that due to BBUSL requiring the scaffold to be removed to install the earth mat, access via mobile platform should be avoided. Would suggest going forward early engagement of Test Engineer, (and again, I know we only had just employed Miles so it wasn’t possible and I did agree with Paul that a mobile platform would be ok, in hindsight it wasn’t the best option)."
"Pipelines Division constructed bespoke cable trailer for contract. Very successful outcome which was photographed and widely distributed within SSE. Murphy - The management of vehicle and plant weekly, monthly and 6 weekly service / inspections was very time consuming and costly (vehicles has to be taken to Newcastle from Perth)."
"the progression of material requisitions by Dinnington Buying Dept was deemed to be rather slow and caused a certain amount of frustration / fiction for the site management team. Cable Orders - Placement of orders is very time consuming due to internal approval process. This could prejudice our recovery under LME clause / cause us to payout extra monies that can’t be recovered contractually Cable Orders - ABB Limited supplied several drums of cable that were at variance to what was ordered (factory manufacturing issue). On this occasion we managed to re-site joint bays, but this might not be the case on future jobs. Cement Bound Sand - It was possible to obtain this material locally and had to be resourced from a facility near Aberdeen - actual cost to bill allowance implication! Also, several potential suppliers couldn’t be used because they didn’t have the appropriate testing certificates for the sand they intend to use (cost £2k for sampling regime - Southampton University) The amount of CBS used was far in excess of what was allowed for in the tender due trenches on site having to be dug wider to cater for side wall collapse due to water logged ground. Est’s extra over cost - £60K plus. Murphy - A detailed MATERIAL TAKE OFF wasn’t available for this contract. Suggested that this be prepaid for all future jobs."
"Nexus Limited - Off-site fatality occurred on other SSE project, so the commencement of jointing works was delayed until 19th April. Nexus Ltd accelerated their programme by bringing more resource, who worked longer hours each day. Performance Rating: 8 out of 10. Scaffolding: Tone Limited - Were seen as slightly complacent about the site safety regime at first, but came good eventually. Scaffolding viewed as a ‘massive’ structure! Sheath Testing: Murphy - Some subcontractors were employed without a full subcontract in place."
"Although SSE placed the contract with us several months later than the date originally proposed at tender submission, we failed to revise the key programme dates. Having signed the contract, we prejudiced our right to claim for acceleration costs when we were held to the original completion dates (couldn’t be changed due to booked outages). Winter working was a significant risk that arose from the above. Murphy - It was alleged by SSE’s Contract Quantity Surveyor that we had missed a significant opportunity to claim additional monies in respect of SSE’s contractual failure to provide access to site on key dates (never investigated as an alternative method of payment in respect of working was agreed upon). Murphy - We were initially slow in producing monthly programme revisions. Although the matter was addressed, the timely update and submission of same is of critical importance. Murphy - Agreeing a suitable type of bond proved to be very difficult and discussions continued well past the date of contract award. SSE frustration was such that they initially threatened to terminate the contract. Finally proposing a ‘cash bank’ offer in lieu of bond provision. Murphy - Tender allowance for Jointing costs need to be reviewed against actual outturn. There seemed to be confusion as to what had been allowed when it came to negotiating a price for the works. Murphy - 3rd party tried to use a pre-condition survey on access roads against us to apportion the deterioration of poorly constructed Murphy - General office administration was undertaken Murphy Project Manager. This could have caused significant problems if he hadn’t been prepared to work over and above the call of duty."
This role was undertaken by the contract’s Project Manager which placed him under unnecessary pressure at times - more resource required in bill. Murphy - Sheath Testing of Cables prior to installation needs to be better catered for. Murphy - No allowance in tender for Factory. Acceptance Tests visit (potential overseas visits) Murphy - Local Photographer employed with mixed results – mainly due to Murphy staff not being utilised in ‘staged’ situations.
"Asked for better clarification / coordination between contractors on future projects i.e. Who’s is PC on sites / work faces that need to be accessed via areas controlled by others. Client - Excavation designs i.e. control of angles of repose was well managed by Murphy. Client - Questioned quality and suitability of standard Murphy PPE (winter working etc.). Client - SCAFFOLDER ISSUE AT BALBLAIR Scaffolders stood on top of scaffold and comprised clearance distances (major safety contravention) Scaffold ing was a major issue due to its size and maintaining clearances (even though adjacent lines were switched out) • Better method needed, more robust system going forward • Scaffolding structure employed seemed massive. • Size of scaffold poles queried (4 to 5m lengths) • Risk Register & RAMS Need to be much better - Professional advice required. Murphy - QUENSH site inspections were conducted by several persons at the same time - Yorkshire based – significant travelling and overnight accommodation costs incurred. Demarcation of working areas needs to be better. • Wind loadings determined size of structure - didn’t fail. • SSE has limited experience of solid panels on scaffolds • Permanent attachment to scaffold • Better to nominate people who’ve held permits in other REC’s."
"Expressed the view Murphy’s environmental support came mainly through procedures & inspections - suggested that a formal site presence might assist the Project Team better. Client - Murphy complimented on management of drainage. Scottish Env’l Protection Agency (Iain Thomas) - Suggested that ‘CARE’ applications weren’t the right way to address certain stream / burn crossings due to extent of required engineering works. Ditto above - Use of hessian & webbing on banks & general reinstatement works highly commended. Murphy - Flow rates of stream might have been an issue if we had not changed control methodology from over-pumping to flume pipes (Safety, Cost & Programme). 3rd Party issue - BBUL encouraged Black Grouse to occupy areas beneath Towers after strimming area (cleared areas are preferred as ‘leks’ for breeding) N/A 3rd Party issue - BBUL constructed access roads weren’t fit for purposes due to poor sub-base material (burrow pit) and excessive inclines. Caused numerous problems, slit run off, suitability of transport etc. N/A Murphy - Winter working necessitated significant."
"suggested ‘early doors’ Murphy involvement. Client - Community Liaison Officer issued specially prepared ‘van packs’ to Murphy Teams Above issued Business cards to Murphy so they could be handed out to redirect MOP’s enquires N/A Client - Praised Murphy for the following; 1. Manufacture of coffee table from redundant cable drum and placement in local picnic area. 2. £500 pounds’ donation to Highlands Land Trust - extremely well received locally. 3. Use of free issue magnetic signs on vehicles “much better than BBUL in this respect” 4. Providing Banksman training for SSE employees. Murphy - Prohibition notice served by Perth & Kinross Council on Murphy site establishment located within Farmers yard opposite cabling route. It transpired that the Farmer didn’t have the necessary planning consents and that the site was of archaeological interest. SSE admitted that they had misled us as to the suitability of the foregoing and paid our demobilization and remobilization costs. • Formal meeting with Landowners needed to take over land • Produce a drawing of land requirements, possibly helps to identify ‘Box’ areas for crossings / lateral access."
factor in the successful outcome of the project; Murphy response to SSE fatality was appreciated The contract was deemed to be a significant success SSE “first scheme on Beauly Rationalisation Project delivered on time” Scheme specific presentation requested.
"BBUL - to take over Murphy compound for at least one month to use as a storage area for steel work. Thereafter, they are to undertake restoration works as required prior to returning area to Landowner."
"3 Month notices not considered in programme which caused delayed start. The tender allowances were based on 18 weeks. The first contract programme submitted showed a construction period of 22 weeks. This was then revised to 26 weeks. The actual period on site was 34 weeks (6 weeks of this was due to delay caused by the damaged cable issue) There was also an additional holiday period that was not allowed. LA noticing to be confirmed at time of tender when working in the highway. Greater in put required from engineering teams at time of tender to ensure methodologies align, EOT was not granted due to all risk contract. Sheath testing cables on receipt would have identified the issue at an early stage and prevented delays. This would have required a higher spec cable which should be considered on all future projects."
LA’s happy with JMS standard of workmanship. Deploy the same standards of workmanship across the BU.
Additional depth required to meet DNO requirements. Larger duct sizes required to meet DNO requirements. Larger fiber cable required to meet DNO requirements. Ensure end user (DNO’s) specifications are considered on all future contestable connections works and that the Wind Farm operators’ specs are questioned at time of tender.
Reinstatement teams under. resourced and struggled to keep up with the excavation teams. Ensure resources are made available whenever possible.
"ECO Drill (HDD contractor) whilst very competitive, they require a high level of on site management and are generally untidy. Subcontractor evaluation to be completed and to ensure all HDD contractors are suitable reviewed at procurement stage."
"All risk contract price agreed on a re-measureable tender price. DNO requirements not considered at time of tender. Council forced JMS into footpath from C/way due to section 58 restrictions. 4No. Drills required on project and only one allowed for. Large waste qty’s taken off site with associated costs to the contract. No cost forecast undertaken No special TM allowances made. Assumed all JMS control. Foam concrete backfill used to speed up installation and saved costs. Payment milestones not nailed down firmly. This required JMS to complete most of the work before any payments would be made. Poor submission of allocation sheets. All risk contracts not to be taken without sufficient risk allowances and agreements by all parties concerned. i.e. engineer, procurement, commercial. This should be done on all projects and will be taken up with the commercial team to ensure this is not repeated. Sufficient time at the project start up needs to be provided. The use of Foam concrete backfills to be consider on future projects. Subject to council acceptance and design criteria. Wording of milestones to be clear that they apply to JMS scope and not the whole works. PM’s / QS’s to be briefed on the importance of allocation sheets. Additional resources to be considered to manage this process should the contract require."
No contract reviews undertaken. Sheath damage on cable caused additional time and costs in rectification. All contract reviews to be picked up in Monthly BU meeting. All cables to be supplied with Graphite Coating or facilities to enable sheath testing on receipt of cables. This will allow early identification of manufacturing issues.
Joint Bay Flooded caused major programme delays as outages had to be cancelled and re-booked. Civils team made slow progress in road works. Cable installation works bettered programme allowance. Murphy direct employees to be used to monitor joint bays or subcontractors to be briefed/trained sufficiently to manage. Ensure suitably experienced resources are available for the tasks. Continue to plan cable pulling with sufficient lead in and use JM experienced labour.
The transition joint bay required detailed temp works and scaffolding to manage exiting oil cables. Slow progress on temp. Works design. Power BU to source more local TW design to enable better management of. Final joint bay design was successful in moving the old oil cables. Ensure appropriate levels of input and an early stage.
Internal temp. Works design was slow. Slow progress on temp. Works design. Power BU to source more local TW design to enable better management of.
No guaranteed labour force. Labour changed on numerous occasions which caused issues with production and training. Only two experienced cable pullers were used on the project. Cable pulling was still successful. For the re-visit a ‘local’ General operative was required to operate pumps at the joint bays to ensure flooding did not occur again Minimize labour changes during a project and ensure the correct resource is allocated from the outset. Ensure JM has sufficient resource manage cable pulling activities. Alongside other project commitments. Good liaison with Golborne Rail resulted in a very reliable operative being utilised on the contract.
Material and sub-contract orders had to be chased repeatedly at the start of the contract by the PM.
"Sourcing New Subcontractors H&Askam (Jointing Subcontractor) proved good onsite and struggled with back office support. ENWL required that we obtained their authorisations for the specific jointers and mates who were actually going to complete the joints HT Scaffolding proved unreliable. ECO Drill (HDD contractor) whilst very competitive, they require a high level of on site management and are generally untidy. Utilizing a new subcontractor gained savings on the oil transition jointing costs. Meeting to be arrange with H&Askam to review project support and discuss future works as they could offer JM potential cost effect options on future projects. PM had to chase H&Askam repeatedly for jointers training etc. H&Askam then changed the jointers who they were sending causing more applications for authorisations. H&Askam failed to send their jointers for the relevant interviews on two occasions. This caused the client to lose confidence in our jointing abilities. Recommend that Murphy use self-employed jointers directly so we have better control. Subcontractor evaluation to be completed and to ensure all scaffold contractors are suitable reviewed at procurement stage. Subcontractor evaluation to be completed and to ensure all HDD contractors are suitable reviewed at procurement stage."
"Compound Rent & Security Missed Cable recovery methodology proposed was not suitable. It was proposed to pull cables directly out of the ground instead of excavating the full route. Joint Bay pumping & Supervision was under estimated. No tender breakdown was available. No site visits by contracts manager. Left client with a poor perception. Final account showed massive losses on the contract. The main single issue on this project was the flooding of the joint bay. This caused delays, additional civils works, procurement of new jointing materials and subcontractor work. More involvement required at tender stage from Project delivery and management to provide greater scrutiny of tender build ups. Proposed methodology not to be considered on future projects as this is hit and miss when it comes to success. Sufficient allowances to be made for transition joint bay works. All future tenders to be completed by tender team using company software. Contracts manager to ensure each project is visited on a regular basis. To ensure client contact and to demonstrate that each project is important to the company. This issue was caused by subcontract security turning off the joint bay pump following complaints on noise from a resident. Greater attention needs to be given on open excavations, weather conditions and how we manage our subcontractors when left in charge of a site area. This item was discussed at depth with a view that JM personnel should remain responsible on such critical stages of a project or subcontractors should be suitably checked to ensure competence."
"Excellent site records.i.e. daily allocation sheets, site diary. Ensure the importance of records are promoted with the project managers."
Excellent site records. Pm asked for and acted on advice provided by H&S team. Changes in staff caused issues with appointed first aid / fire wardens. No female toilets in welfare setup. Ensure the importance of records are promoted with the project managers. Ensure the importance of records are promoted with the project managers. Ensure that Project Managers proactively arrange training or consider first aid / fire warden responsibilities taking into account duration of job. Issues were raised to Golborne HSQE dept.
Problems with waste transfer notes Skips from Go-Green had issues with documentation.
"Initially landowners were to strong and experienced for the client SSE. Start location on the programme was chopped and changed to accommodate a pre agreed easement. Having to start at different location along the route from Section three instead of Section one at Beauly Substation as one example. Relocation of sealing end compound resulted to reduced cable length known only after procurement. Biosecurity measures which will potentially result in reduced productivity. The costs have been submitted and considered by the client. At the start of the contract, static guards were utilised on the contract. As the contract progressed the need for more guards at the joint bays resulted in extra welfare units being externally hired. As per the contract, JMS were instructed not to have direct contact with Landowner / Tenants. This resulted in SSE staff without experience, making agreements on behalf of the contract, not realizing cost impacts and programme interruptions. JMS to be involved in all pre-site meetings from start of contract to guide SSE. Due to way leaves not being agreed at start of contract cable length changed many times and just pure luck JMS ordered enough cable. No work to commence until way leaves have been agreed with landowners and contract signed so no changes can be introduced. Due to lack of information from client on environmental concerns additional costs and programme extension applied. All information to be presented at earliest opportunity to allow JMS to have plan going forward to allow for such changes. With the help of the security regional department, a new camera system was put on place to reduce security costs onsite. The benefit resulted in less guards working through the nights, and having a live feed from portable devices to view the site at any time. The guards were then reduced to only at the main compound and contacted by the camera system operator if there was an intrusion detection. However, not 100% this is the way forward as the site don’t think camera company give same level of security at joint bays."
"The site team managed two contracts out of the same yard, as the location was ideal for both contracts to be run from one location Muir of Ord. Full time engineer required at all times to manage CBS checks as well as depths of installation as the ground condition and profiles changed on a daily bases. Few issues with testing and commissioning with what was required as the men tried but unfortunately didn’t get it on this occasion and the work had to be redone which in turn impacted on the test wagon stay on the job £12,000 a day. Full time surveyor on site, is an advantage as the clients consultant wanting drawings updating constantly. With the distance of the Scottish contracts, the engineer was all overall the place, resulting in missing days where engineering resource was required. Site team had to undertake engineering role when required. More engineers required in Scotland. More experienced men on how the electric side of things worked are required, there is a high number of across the spread men, but low on substation knowledge. Full time surveyor on contracts going forward."
"Approval of Data Package 6 delayed by Client but eventually approved at last minute to enable cable procurement and maintain the construction programme. JMS design on the link box chambers, tender drawing to have more detail, and dictate exactly what needs to be installed onsite, and not left to interpretation. All drawings updated from site and controlled by site team. The changing of designs / drawings from the design department post construction, resulting in late ordering of materials or having to go back on work to meet new design. Type test joints not approved and had major concerns with the client this needs to be avoided as it could have led to the system being rejected from SSE. Must keep client in loop at all times. A standard design needs be in place across the board for link box chambers, as all the Scottish contracts utilised different methods. This has resulted in a major disagreement with the client and potential remedial works. Having a surveyor who is fully competent in CAD, has been a real help to the contract. Having a surveyor who is fully competent in CAD, has been a real help to the contract."
"All temporary works recorded in register and kept up to date throughout the project, correct documentation in place by TWC."
"At the beginning of the project the mix of cable men and pipeline men were wrong clashing scenario, ‘Who knows more, attitude’. After time this worked well as the knowledge was combined from both teams. With ongoing works and with the substation and cable pulling both working together as one. This is now not an issue as both backgrounds need each other to achieve best results, now working as one team. Training department managed to source local providers to meet the site requirements for training, this saved sending the personnel on a 400 mile trip each way and leaving site for three days. Site team very experienced now and the client can see it. The additional admin staff on the two contracts was critical, as they freed up time for the management to concentrate on the overall scale of works and programme, and responding to an ever more demanding client. More integrating required with cable and pipelines, the experience of both divisions could benefit future projects. Keep sourcing local training facilities for the men working away. Ensure the contract is appropriately resourced from the start."
"Exchanging the external hired plant for internal plant, was cost effective for the company as a whole. Due to the widespread of the Scottish contracts, and only one fitter available, the requirement required for maintenance was over stretched. This resulted in some sites being missed out due to commitments on others. At present plant spend in excess of £2m what percentage is profit to plant department when all plant is not new. If we bought all new plant at start of job, we could have sold back to plant with £ 1m profit straight onto site team’s bottom line. Ensuring internal plant is available no matter the location of the contracts. More fitters to be available to work in Scotland with new contracts starting in near future. Plant department need to be involved at tender stage to see if there can give greater discount on rates as at present no real benefit to site teams costs as could get better deals if went to supplier direct."
"Due to spur of the moment extras onsite with the client, there has been a need for materials to be procured urgently. Buying department has been very helpful with the ordering of the materials at short notice. The site management produced a form to record the visual inspections of the cable drums as they arrived onsite. This was then incorporated into the Inspection Test Plan, and has been supplied to all the sites going forward. Keep working on new ideas."
"Delays in orders being supplied to the subcontractors, even though the requisitions had been sent to Dinnington months in advance. Subcontractors became agitated and having to start works without an order to keep to JMS programme. Subcontracts managed from site as scope of works changed on weekly bases prestart meeting held before works commenced to make sure no delays were JMS fault as at present sub contracts becoming more commercially aware something to be mindful of going forward. A small team to be set up to concentrate solely on the Scottish contracts, for materials and subcontractors. Every contract to be specific to the task and have more commercial awareness."
"Tender stage job price at 9% overheads being now being charged in excess of the original figure, this makes it very difficult to show a healthy bottom line at the end of the contract. Understanding the contract JMS didn’t have an experienced QS on site and at times were caught out by the client on financial matters which we managed to turn around when the right people got introduced. Administration was managed when 2 new members of staff were employed to reduce work load on everyone this was identified at early stage however JMS didn’t understand the work load involved with the running of two contracts. Weekly meeting held with client to discuss works and resolve any potential issues coming up about land entry. Having managed these contracts JMS team have now a full understanding of SSE contracts as to what is acceptable and what is not going forward. Agreed percentages to remain the same from tender stage. Key members of staff need the right level of experience and commercial awareness. As large sums of money is involved. Site team should decide on the resource onsite. Keep client involved from the start. Building client relationships."
"Jointer Subcontractor not following JMS drawings. This could have been prevented if the Engineering resource wasn’t spread so thin between other working contracts within Scotland. There was a delay on a previous contract regarding handover files, which then became an issue on this contract. As client’s personnel changed different requirements were needed. This again shows SSE’s lack of understanding. Collate information on how the client wants the handover files at the beginning and have this agreed."
"Communication with Highway Council was very good and always kept informed of progression. Toward the back end of the contract, HSQE resource was moved elsewhere leaving the contracts exposed. The client also picked up on paying the costs for personnel which were not onsite. Site setup Ideal location to cover North Scotland as a drop off point with all the welfare facilities and Client use on daily basis. Keep good relationship with Local Authorities. Better communication between all departments to ensure the contracts have the cover they require and no one is left exposed to the client. To keep in mind when deciding to demobilize yard or not."
"No Incidents or accidents on this contract. With onsite support of first rate H&S advisor who got involved from day one and who also covered environmental, until this resourced was removed. All water controlled and drainage first class, help with the environmental team quick response to any potential hazards. Keep high experienced personnel within JMS. Two-man environmental team to be put in place on each contract, ensuring the site is well maintained and meets all environmental consents."
Issues with cable and joints. Waiting on report.
Programs not issued to site on A1 paper only A3 so could not be read. Programs not submitted to site in Project so could not be. Description of activity not at end of activity bar so made difficult to follow. Issue hard copies of Programs to site on paper large enough that they can be read. Issue Program to site in Project format so site can manage the program and send back to programmer to input in P6 or put P6 on site computer. Put activity description at end of activity bar to make easier to read.
Technical support was intermittent. Identify times on Program when more technical support is required.
Detail the fibre route on the drawings so fibre laid through joint bays then had to be diverted. End of fibre route unknown
Scaffolding. Joint Bays. Late placing of order with subcontractors for jointing meant no input from subcontractors in scaffolding Resulting in scaffolding missing a level. Late placing of order with subcontractors resulted in joint bays not being big enough.
Short on Rotor operators only one willing to travel. Short of MEWP operators. SSE permit holders. A further three have been trained. More operatives require training. No permit holders on site. Training is near impossible to get on Senior management need to raise with SSE directors.
Cable drum trailer. In need of certification.
Sealing ends. Cable and joints. Have long lead times check on contract award and time of tender. Check lead times on contract award and at time of tender.
Jointers. Poorly written order resulted in poor understanding of limits and responsibility of works.
Tender Handover. No tender handover with site team due to quick start.
ROI sheets not uniform through contract .Has been rectified.
Address issues that may require dewatering early as SEPA may require Registration. Address water crossings early as SEPA will have to be contacted and may require Registration.
"Peat Bogs. Need identifying at tender stage and environmental considerations to be undertaken at this stage i.e., dewatering. Expensive to cross."
"Wooden tamp being utilised to tamp the CBS in. Use of Bog Mats for long sections of Haul roads. Previous contractor has installed bog mats as continuous haul roads. During wet weather activities this has resulted in health and safety issues. Brian Hamilton has begun using a modified light duty wacker plate. The client wants us to do a Risk assessment on this but early indications are it will speed up the process, reduce repetitive strain on operatives and provide a suitable finish on the CBS for the cable. For future works bog mats to be utilised in short sections only for short duration works or as additional support under/over stone roadways. JMS have ceased installing bog mats along haul roads and have been replacing broken/damaged ones. (this has resulted in significant costs and time replacing, down time due to H&S issues)."
"Client requires drawings prior to cable pull, and prior to CBS and back fill to reassure them that minimum levels are being adhered to. The Client has provided no invert levels for general trench works apart from standard details for cross sections. Assuming topsoil as 150mm thick JMS are currently excavating by “a rule of thumb” a dig of 1200mm below subsoil level. From standard details this is +75mm deep for agricultural land and +225mm for open country side. JMS are taking X, Y co-ordinates from the Client provided 2D CAD drawings. This is proving problematical when we then produce long section profiles of ground levels against cable levels using 3D cad software, together with cross sections of ground level and cable level every 5m, considering we have an original ground level survey on a 20m grid. Engineers are to provide detailed surveys, every 5m, to the design team in good time following each work activity in order to allow the full section to be drawn up in good time for each work activity. Use the 3D CAD software before excavation as opposed to afterwards. Produce a 3D ground profile with X, Y and Z values, offsetting this 1200mm vertically and then importing this trench invert profile into site engineers GPS instruments will allow immediate checks both in the X Y plan view and for trench depth Z."
"For the installation of ducts that go around bends, the ducts are having to be held in place to ensure that they are in the correct position prior to concrete pour. Temporary Works design check category numbers are not included on the JMS formal design check sheet. Design check numbers need to be noted to ensure that checks are compliant with British Standards. JMS proposed to use sections of scaffold tubes to hold the PE ducting in place. It was advised that metallic tubes would not be acceptable. JMS poured the concrete in sections, such that the scaffold tube could be removed, allowing the concrete to hold the ducting in place. It was requested that the JMS form MOH0001-FOR-00089 would be revised to allow for the inclusion of a check category number. This is being actioned by the Temporary Works Managers. In the meantime, temporary works designers are including check categories within their design summaries."
Following minor changes to RAMS the PC are carrying out a full review and returning significant amount of comments on previously accepted RAMS. A document will be created to highlight the areas that have been altered on a previously accepted method statement to ensure Prysmian only review the changes made to the document rather than the method statement being put through the whole process again.
Ongoing delays with setting up landfill locations to allow wastes to be removed off site. Site set up is 4 hour turn around for a wagon while a landfill is located 15 minutes away from the site. Raise issues with Senior management on the control of waste and how the company’s protocol in relation to reducing numbers of companies on the list is putting the company at risk.
"Approved for Construction design for the A540 includes errors in titling and minor detailing. This has lead to errors in the development of Temporary Works designs. JMS to review in detail all designs that are issued, to ensure that the designs reflect what they client requires to be constructed. Ensure that correct information is supplied to the TW design teams by way of a detailed design brief. If requirements of the design change, ensure that information is passed through to the design team through supply of correct information and revision of the design brief."
"Temporary Works designs are required to be signed as Approved .This is under the role of the PC and TWC or a nominated design approver. For this site, approval of TWDs has been designated to JMS Design Co[1]ordinator."
"Plant/Tools need to be checked prior to be taking to site, we had an incident with tower lights where we had to stop work due to not being fit for purpose .Yardmen to check all plant prior to sending out to site. Logs to be kept of location."
"In terms of requisitions, the foremen on site have become liable on making requests on materials that need at least a two-day turnover to acquire on site. This is causing unneeded stress and arguments for several employees. This hasn’t been addressed, but I feel the need for one of the foremen to make a note on needed materials daily to prevent a more leniency on the time span for materials to arrive on site. According to protocol the two-day leeway on expectancy on materials needs to be met to prevent future argumentative and stressful occurrences."
"The way delivery tickets were originally filed (copied and put into ring binders) meant that we were not only wasting time and effort trying to keep on top of the dates, but also the different types of tickets (waste, materials and Plant) meant that tickets were becoming misplaced, this also included the hard copies as not everything ended up being scanned and copied onto the system. RFI’s not sent through on time to Prysmian. Implementing the use of goods return sheets in the process of both GRN-ing and sending off the hard copies of delivery tickets, has helped minimize the paper load within the filing system (cost effective) which is also benefiting on an environmental and waste scale. JMS personal to utilise SWAS where applicable and communicate better as a team."
Confusion between RFI and ITPs. Attaching RFI’s to ITP’s to ensure they don’t get lost in transit and Engineers always have them to hand.
"Previous issues with parking, vehicles blocking one another in has caused arguments amongst both accompanying parties within the project. A revised traffic management plan was put into place and instructed for use with immediate effect. The new parking layout is not only more spacious with the way it incorporates a much more everyday shopping precinct feel, but is much easier to maneuvers around and effectively gives everyone a space in which they can freely park their vehicle."
"Idle plant on site, when machine is not in use machine operators sat in machine with engine running. TBT to be carried out to all persons in relation to idle plant running effects on environmental and financial."
"On the Murphy server there are more than several revisions of nearly every register for multiple documents that cannot be removed or edited due to permissions on the IT system. Other than the need for IT to address this first hand, there are one or two employees that have taken it upon themselves to prioritize registers within their name which they update on a weekly basis. This is to prevent the need to make more revisions and copies of documents which has also reduced the confusion of who should ideally be updating said registers."
Wooden tamp being utilised to tamp the CBS in. JMS spoke to land and marine about getting a metal tamp made to help the CBS team with the compaction as the feedback was that the wooden ones they are currently utilizing are not ideal for the task. Having trailed the steel tamp it became apparent it was too heavy due to continuous lifting over the across. Aluminum tamps currently being manufactured.
"Topographical survey carried out collecting information in a 20m grid. NGTS 3.05.07 requires as Built information to show cross sections in 5m intervals thus leaving a lot of interpolation of ground levels for the As Built stage. This would also help close out the arguments of client/third parties as to the cover to the cable. Civil contract drawings were completed using a 3D mapping software and as Built surveys will be completed in 3D so JMS require a 3D mapping software in order to complete the drawings. insufficient setting out coordinates have been supplied on the Construction drawings. As most section had been top soil stripped prior to Prysmian informing JMS of as Built requirements, JMS have carried out an interpolation of the topographical levels. JMS suggest that going forward more detailed survey information is collected. JMS have applied for Civil 3D to be installed on the CAD technician’s Computer. JMS requested the designers to revise the drawing pack to show additional information and to do a sense check on the information already supplied. Designers provided a separate document of setting out coordinates, not showing points on drawings, which was not Approved for Construction."
"TWC stated that excavation tags for the close boarded excavations are to be signed off prior to the CBS being installed and new tags signed off post the CBS being installed. In dry conditions when stepped excavations are used it is difficult to ensure that soil does not break off side of excavation and fall into the trench. This is prohibited by Prysmian as they will not allow for potential for any material to fall on the cable during the pulling works. JMS argued that this was incorrect, in that the installation of the CBS was included as part of the Temporary Works design. JMS have continued with signing off pre and post CBS installation. Since this was raised JMS have refrained from using the stepped excavation and have used the close boarded excavation. JMS have also proposed the use of a battered V-trench excavation which should remove the risk of parts of the soil dropping into the trench."
Plant arriving to site and not working. P&T informed of the issues to replace. More robust checks required by the P&T division prior to sending out plant.
"Recycled 6F2 stone been delivered to site in very low volumes, Additional suppliers to be found so volumes can be met."
"No procedure being in place for handover docs to be issued to Prysmian. i.e. weekly/monthly, electronic or hard copy and no point of contact. Work packs being produced but waiting on numerous occasions for accepted RAMS to be issued back from Prysmian. No audits undertaken on site internally to ensure we are working to all procedures and all documentation is in place. Previous contractor works not installed correctly and Prysmian confirming at the last minute. Clarification to be sort when crossing over public paths to ensure the relevant people are aware and permissions are in place. Protocol to be put in place with Prysmian. EWN to be issued to Client of delays associated with late RAMS acceptance. Audit to be arrange with Dinnington QA department. Contact Prysmian for all as built in formation so as JMS can sense check to help reduce delays. To date no information provided (27/06/15). Prysmian to provide list of all permissions."
Deliveries of concrete issues from Hansons. Late and none turn up to site. Order being set up with several suppliers to alleviate delays.
Control and receipt of training records. Choice of trench excavation has reduced a significant amount of hazards. RAMS not being briefed to workforce correctly by site supervisors. Daily Risk Assessments not being complete correctly to identify all hazards. Lifting equipment on site without identification. A specific email address needs to be set up for all training records and requests e.g. westernlinktraining@murphygroup.co.uk. JMS have proposed the use of V Trench to remove all hazards. This has not been accepted to date due to commercial reasons. Managers to ask random questions on RAMS to determine if workforce understand procedure. SHE advisors to check work packs and brief foremen/supervisors on how to compile. New lifting equipment to be quarantined by the store man and H&S advisor notified to arrange tagging.
"Site waste now becoming a problem across the site, Arrow Park been used as a dumping ground. Landfill sites to be found to start transferring waste from site."
Change in location of main compound set up due to land issues. Additional costs to contract. issues with gaining access to certain sites along the works. Client constantly requesting works to be carried out of sequence. Issues round programme dates. Other compounds to be removed and demobilized to remove these costs. Works to be carried out at weekend to eliminate delay to programme. JMS prioritizing works in other areas. JMS require instructions and time moving forward so as key dates are not affected.
Short period to get RAMS issued following contract award and commencement on site. HSG47 compliance. inspection system with their client. Very onerous and causing delays on site. JMS have progressed the important RAMS to commence. HSG47 checklist & inspections. JMS issuing in advance and have dedicated resource to work with the engineers.
"The contract is a Build only contract with confirmation of design being complete pre construction. Design not complete. Pre Con drainage design not complete in time to allow works to proceed as per programme. Design information on GI is completely incorrect to areas on site. Design is for closed board timber trenching. This has serious environmental and H&S issues during construction. Design width of the easement is extremely narrow for the works. Services on drawings not as being discovered during construction. Resulting in delays on site. Duct block designs on the contract are excessive and majority not required. DCCAR approved design yet to be complete by Prysmian. JMS to assist where possible. To date Prysmian have rejected assistance. JMS requested design from Client and have drainage company mobilize as soon as possible. Priorities works in other areas. MS have requested further information from the client and carry out trial holes. JMS have offered a V trench design to the client to eliminate the risks associated with constructing. JMS have requested additional land take for storage areas. However, this has been rejected and JMS must finance any additional lands. Backfill excavations while new design is resolved and return to complete. JMS have issued TQ and are in process of removing large amounts from the design."
Temporary works Coordination is managed by the client Prysmian. Look delays in having temporary works signed off. Designs currently on the database from previous contractor are inadequate to the free issue materials. Due to services being incorrect as per the design. Delays on site due to additional designs required. JMS to possibly fulfil the role of TWC. Discussions to cover CDM requirements to be progressed. JMS to undertake new designs. JMS have employed Maybe to develop designs for all eventualities.
Additional resources required due to the requirement of paperwork and inspections by the client. Dedicated temporary works engineer/designer required. JMS have brought in the required resource so as to not affect works. JMS have employed maybe to carry out works. Possible take over the TWC role to control designs.
Int/Ext plant hire sheets incorrect. Excavator delivered to site with no paperwork. Check and verify all plant sheets. Discrepancies queried and remedied as soon as distributed. Plant quarantined and inspected upon delivery. Request certs from P&T.
Storage of material issues due to easement width. Delays in materials arriving on site due to ongoing issues with procurement team. Haul rd. stone to be recycled for cost saving and environmental benefit. Materials to be transported to site only as required. Resulting in potential delays.
Delays in getting subcontracts placed on contract. Has resulted in delays to the programme. Issues have been raised with regional managers.
JMS are not PC on site and being manage by Prysmian. JMS have implemented the SMS from the ISS projects to increase safety control on site.
Works carried out by previous contractor not as per the design. Works being checked by JMS and where required rectified.
Width of Easement issues: No room for storage of material No room for welfare on site Segregation of plant and pedestrian issues. Bog mats being used as haul road and installed several years previous. Rotten and breaking. Ensure suitable welfare is available on site. Only transport materials to site when required. Use small chemical toilets along room and located full welfare where possible. Limit amount of plant and vehicle movements on site. Limit amount of transport on site. Remove broken bog mats as required. Site foremen to liaise with SHE advisors to determine minimum requirement.
Ground water issues in sections. Quality of recycled aggregate arriving on site. Permit to pump being implemented in these sections and managed by env advisor on site. Segregate with visqueen where possible. Due to easement restrictions storage of soil and materials against topsoil. Licenses and certificates to be reviewed by Env advisor prior to orders being placed. WRAP aggregates quality protocol.
Client issuing designs and continuously retracting. Resulting in ceasing of works. Road closures not being granted by local authority for cable installations in section 1 and 2. Road closures not being granted by local authority for ducting installation on Birkenhead road. Works required due to past contractor installing incorrect. Road closure not being granted for the crossing of Frankby rd. Road closures for crossings not being granted until school holidays. Delays to the POW. Inadequate amount of temporary works supervisors on the contract. Completed works packs not being returned to the office following works. EWN issued to Client on delays. JMS installed off road hard standing for the wagon to site for the cable pulls. JMS propose to return to original design of HDD. Since been rejected by Prysmian and will now result in delay to installation of two number sections of cable. EWN issued to Client and programme amended to suit. Programme adjusted accordingly but results in excess delays to cable installation. JMS have proposed trenchless crossings of which has been rejected by the client. JMS have proposed Prysmian negotiate with Land owners for additional lands for wagons to be housed off road for cable install. This is ongoing. Register of issue developed and work packs to be signed out and in. in addition TBT brief to pack holders explaining the importance of returning.
Client issuing designs and continuously retracting. Resulting in ceasing of works. Setting out information incorrect on design drawings. Design drawings amateur. No confirmation on as built requirements from client. EWN issued to Client on delays. JMS have requested the correct information. To date not received. JMS cad technician having to address issues to allow works to progress. JMS have requested definite requirement. No information to date.
Design has DTS tube on the cable fixed with cable ties and upon installing the CBS the DTS tube moves to the side of the cable. CBS not being placed on Visqueen when being stored on easement prior to installation in trench. CBS installed by hand until up past the top of the DTS tubing so as tube remains on top of the cable. TBT talk carried out and not being stored correct.
Client not following CDM when designing works. Comments in meetings by client as to not caring on the risk of men and they only have interest on protecting the cable. Extremely deep open cut crossings being design when HDD should be utilised. Prysmian do not like HDD and deep excavations are putting men at risk. Crossings of major highways with fast flowing traffic open cut when should be HDD to eliminate the risk. Open cut of the 2km to remain open along A540 until cable is installed increasing dangers on site. JMS director to raise design H&S issues with the Prysmian project director. JMS to propose HDD. Being rejected by client JMS director to raise design H&S issues with the Prysmian project director. JMS director to raise design H&S issues with the Prysmian project director. JMS to propose HDD. Being rejected by client JMS propose installing as ducting to reduce risk. Rejected by Prysmian as ultimate responsibility is protecting the cable.
Delays on site due to issue of permit to pumps. Environmental advisor to review and train foremen to issue such permits.
Engineers currently ordering the CBS resulting in excess waste. Input from staff to Lessons learnt is inadequate. Foremen to take responsibility of ordering materials for their works to manage waste. To be improved moving forward.
"Flume pipes not extended a sufficient distance past the easement and use of plastic pipe as flumes. Hazards include, Danger to heavy traffic crossing over the flume close to head wall. Constant damage and collapse of headwall increases risk to persons on repair, increased risk of environmental incidents as shortage of space to erect suitable /long-term silt mitigation, Heavy traffic causing a bend effect on the plastic pipe, raising the ends, resulting in decreased flow of water through the flume, possibility of water following the line of the flume pipe into excavations. Use good diameter steel pipes and extend well beyond easement width. Use good diameter steel pipes and extend well beyond easement width."
"There has been issues with teeing the Land and Marine HDD as Built information into the surveyed cable data, to the extent that one of the HDDs were up to a couple of meters out from the cable data. JMS held a meeting with Land and Marine. Whenever the information is available, JMS supply the local cable survey and HDD tie ins to Land and Marine, and Land and Marine use this information to assist in developing their as Built Information."
"Assess suitability of trackway for access in comparison to stone haul roads. In this instance the track way was not fit for purpose for the task it needed to fulfil. Ground too wet and resultantly cannot cope with the traffic) Thinking the topsoil should have been stripped regardless. Another problem is that the solid newt panels hold the water inside the track (they penetrate the ground some 400mm), so it ponds and nowhere to escape. Challenge client on agreement with land owners where ground conditions are not favorable to use of trackway construction."
"Poor quality of door retainers on welfare units, Hazards inc entrapment of fingers, while disengaging retainer, Increased risk of injury caused by door slam/swinging in wind. Commercially, this can result in significant repair, Structural damage to the doors and even the units have been muted to date. Ensure good quality door closures are fitted to cabins prior to hire agreement."
"Duct blocks not extended far enough past obstacle and invert depth not reduced due to using straight pipes. Resultant problems inc, having to install additional temp works when marrying in trench , more pumping activities , CTV ops working in deep excavations, operatives sitting in deep excavations while lubing cable. Sand bags have been used to protect the cables in the interim backfill of joint bays. It takes a long time to fill these bags and install them as per the design. It takes longer to remove the sand bags when the joint bays are needed to be opened up again. Design team have to request survey information from engineers. Survey information is presented on a SD card. Solution- Using preformed bends of an acceptable degree to bring the duct invert to a safe working height at each end of the duct block, all deep excavation work could be carried out during initial duct block works utilizing trench boxes and ramped accesses. JMS have proposed a change to use 1-ton sand bags rather than smaller sand bags, where possible. These will be easier to fill and quicker to remove than the smaller sand bags. Survey information should be saved on the F drive. These should be saved per section once surveys are complete. This will ensure that surveys are available to JMS personnel at all times, and that information is saved in case the tools used are returned to the hire company or P&T."
"Despite successful trailing of Crowd barriers with integral gates on the scaffold edge protection of the standard trench, the site trench excavation teams have reverted to leaving wide access points that are protected by chapter 8 barriers, however when the ladder is installed and access is required, there is an area of unprotected edge. Solution- Inform all supervisors that as a best practice initiative all openings have crowd barriers with integral gates secured to the scaffolding tubes. (These are available on site) Additionally by the design of the crowd barrier a suitable area for resting and securing a ladder exist either side of the gate frame."
Following walk around the job it was noticed that a lot of drawings within the work packs were wet due to weather conditions and not easily understandable. JMS have ordered A3 folders with zips to see if it helps. Should this not improve it will be suggested to laminate drawings.
"Approved for Construction design for the A540 includes errors in titling and minor detailing. This has lead to errors in the development of Temporary Works designs. JMS to review in detail all designs that are issued, to ensure that the designs reflect what they client requires to be constructed. Ensure that correct information is supplied to the TW design teams by way of a detailed design brief. If requirements of the design change, ensure that information is passed through to the design team through supply of correct information and revision of the design brief."
"Temporary Works designs are required to be signed as Approved. This is under the role of the PC and TWC or a nominated design approver. For this site, approval of TWDs has been designated to JMS Design coordinator."
"Plant/Tools need to be checked prior to be taking to site, we had an incident with tower lights where we had to stop work due to not being fit for purpose .Yardmen to check all plant prior to sending out to site. Logs to be kept of location."
"In terms of requisitions, the foremen on site have become liable on making requests on materials that need at least a two-day turnover to acquire on site. This is causing unneeded stress and arguments for several employees. This hasn’t been addressed, but I feel the need for one of the foremen to make a note on needed materials daily to prevent a more leniency on the time span for materials to arrive on site. According to protocol the two-day leeway on expectancy on materials needs to be met to prevent future argumentative and stressful occurrences."
"The way delivery tickets were originally filed (copied and put into ring binders) meant that we were not only wasting time and effort trying to keep on top of the dates, but also the different types of tickets (waste, materials and Plant) meant that tickets were becoming misplaced, this also included the hard copies as not everything ended up being scanned and copied onto the system.RFI’s not sent through on time to Prysmian.Implementing the use of goods return sheets in the process of both GRN-ing and sending off the hard copies of delivery tickets, has helped minimize the paper load within the filing system (cost effective) which is also benefiting on an environmental and waste scale.JMS personal to utilize SWAS where applicable and communicate better as a team."
Confusion between RFI and ITPs. JMS sub-contractors not following ITP. Attaching RFI’s to ITP’s to ensure they don’t get lost in transit and Engineers always have them to hand. Quality plan to be issued to all subcontractors as part of the procurement process. Engineers to take ownership of ITPs on their sections including subcontract works.
"Previous issues with parking, vehicles blocking one another in has caused arguments amongst both accompanying parties within the project. A revised traffic management plan was put into place and instructed for use with immediate effect. The new parking layout is not only more spacious with the way it incorporates a much more everyday shopping precinct feel, but is much easier to maneuvers around and effectively gives everyone a space in which they can freely park their vehicle."
"Idle plant on site, when machine is not in use machine operators sat in machine with engine running. Control of Topsoil from plot to plot. TBT to be carried out to all persons in relation to idle plant running effects on environmental and financial. Obtain permission from Prysmian ALO prior to moving topsoil from plot to plot. Client to arrange additional land take in areas of joint bays and duct blocks on future projects."
"On the Murphy server there are more than several revisions of nearly every register for multiple documents that cannot be removed or edited due to permissions on the IT system. Other than the need for IT to address this first hand, there are one or two employees that have taken it upon themselves to prioritize registers within their name which they update on a weekly basis. This is to prevent the need to make more revisions and copies of documents which has also reduced the confusion of who should ideally be updating said registers."
"Too many labour resources were allocated to project at the beginning of the contract period when limited site access was available. Further surplus labour resources were subsequently allocated to project that were simply not required to deliver the works. These two issues led to unnecessary labour costs of approx. £0.5m being incurred which cannot be recovered from the Main Contractor. At a later stage, labour which had been trained and security cleared to work in the substation at Torness had to be reallocated to other projects due to access issues. However, that labour was not reallocated to Torness when required. This led to a subcontractor being employed at an additional cost of c£200k to undertake the works within the substation. Improve management and utilization of direct labour resources. A business wide initiative is already in place for this."
"No systems were put in place to set targets for, measure and manage productivity in real time. This meant that: - • Payments to our operatives were not linked to productivity achieved; • Key data required to support claims for loss of productivity due to Customer changes (e.g. winter working) was not collated. It is recommended that: - • Operatives earnings should be linked to production achieved; • Step should be taken to ensure that detailed production records (diaries; labour allocation and daily outputs achieved) are maintained on every site. • Consideration be given to making sure that the lead quantity surveyor on the project is given responsibility for making sure the production team prepare the necessary production records. • Consideration be given to imposing sanctions on production staff for failure to maintain the required records."
"JMS did not take a robust approach to preparation of the programme and updating the programme to take account of delay events. This resulted in :- • JMS losing track of its performance relative to programme, changes to the critical path of the programme and its entitlements to extensions of time; • JMS allocating its prolongation costs to the wrong items in its initial claim submissions. Cost were incorrectly allocated to Main Contractor issues rather than customer issues. This did not assist with progression of the claim.; and • JMS having to employ a specialist planner to prepare a detailed as built programme in order to understand and demonstrate the causes of delay to the critical path of the programme and its entitlement to an extension of time. JMS should ensure that it takes a consistent, contract compliant to preparation and updating of the programme on all of its projects to help ensure that it has a clear understanding of:- • The cause(s) of delay; • The impact of those delays on the critical path of the programme; and, • Its’ entitlement(s) to extension of time and prolongation costs. JMS should review and look to strengthen and supplement the planning resource on projects where significant changes occur at an early stage to ensure that JMS put is best foot forward with the valuation of claims and variations in a timely manner."
"Record Keeping JMS did not maintain the basic site records required to enable it to evidence the resources employed on the delivery of additional works or its delay and disruption claims. Further many of the photos taken on the project have either been lost and/ or are difficult to sequence due to issues with date and timing issues with the camera used to take the photos. Non availability of records for the construction phase of the project have adversely effected JMS’s ability to evidence the additional costs incurred as a consequence of the change events that have occurred and will prejudice its ability to demonstrate entitlement recover those costs. Ensure detailed daily labour allocations are prepared, submitted to our Client and securely retained within project filing system (not personal drives) on all projects to enable the labour costs incurred to be reliably linked to the relevant site construction operations. This will help JMS to substantiate the cost attributable to claims and other change events and ensure that it collects its full contractual entitlement in respect of changes where retrospective valuation is required."
"The JMS project manager did a good job in ensuring that JMS notified its customer of the claim events. Unfortunately, those notifications were not followed through by good quality contract compliant claims submissions. The management of the N1 business unit did not give sufficient attention to this issue or allocate suitable resources to address the issue in a timely manner. This allowed PCSL to avoid dealing with issues as they arose and resulted in a significant delta developing between the sums paid to JMS and costs incurred. Had JMS escalated the issues at an earlier stage a better outcome would most likely have been achieved. It is recommended that JMS seek to progress and resolve claims on projects during the construction phase with a view to settling its project final accounts by the time construction is completed in order to minimize the impact of change on claims on the businesses’ cash reserves and P&L account. It is recommending that JMS invest in additional resources where required in order to achieve this objective."
Significant deficiencies identified in JMS tender estimate. It appears that the tender team did not: - 1. Undertake a site visit or understand the topography of the site and full extent of the works required to construct the road and water course crossing included in the scope; 2. Fully understand and allow for all elements of the scope of work included in the contract documents (e.g. cabins for customer; site security); 3. Ensure that the material prices obtained at tender were specification compliant; 4. Obtain quotations for the HDD works prior to submission of the tender. 5. Include for sufficient labour to enable the planned production rate to be achieved. 6. Allow for key items of plant required to deliver the tendered scope (e.g. tele handler & dumpers) 7. Allow for any form of site access track. 8. Undertake a quantity check at tender. The project gold exercise identified that these tender errors accounted for c£2.3m of the loss on this project. The business has made significant changes to the work winning process since Torness was bid in 2014. The gateway process is designed to ensure that the majority of the errors described in this section are not repeated. It is understood that a system is currently being put in place to ensure that we capture productivity data from current projects which may be used to verify tender output in future bids. Within that process it is recommended that a review be undertaken focusing on the projects where we have large elements of repeat production to ensure that the record keeping on those projects is sufficiently detailed to enable us to understand the impact of the factors that have adversely affected the output rates achieved.
JMS is unable to locate its copy of the executed contract document. As a result of this there is an element of ambiguity as to the extent of the tender pricing information included in JMS’s subcontract. Recommend that a procedure be put in place to ensure that all original executed contracts are held by either Group Legal or the relevant business unit commercial lead. A copy of the executed version of the Contract should also be stored in Aconex along with any Amendment Deeds.
"The project was not staffed correctly from the outset. A number of key roles were not filled early enough, and several of the staff were not of sufficient caliber for the roles allocated. Some key roles were left vacant for long periods and covered by various staff on an ad hoc basis (e.g. the project QS position was left vacant for 9 months. The project also suffered from a high turnover of staff and use of a large number of contingent workers. It is recommended that JMS review the pipeline of work in Scotland, and give consideration to: - • Establishing a permanent presence in Scotland; and • Seeking to recruit some key project personnel locally in Scotland who want to work “locally” if justified by the strength of the pipeline. It is also recommended that JMS consider introducing staff bonus linked to project completion on projects which are in remote locations and difficult to staff to reduce staff turnover on such projects. Note: The policy now adopted in relation to the appointment of contingent workers and the changes which have been made to business unit management (N1) should help to improve the approach taken to staffing projects in remote locations in the future."
"IT and Document Control - Site Communications. The IT connection at the site was not fit for purpose. This meant that the staff could not productively undertake office work from Site. This resulted in:- key staff working in remote locations and a “skeleton” staff being left on Site;  documents being stored on laptops rather the F Drive; and, documents being “lost” when staff left the business. Ensure that  IT connections provided to sites are fit for purpose; A procedure is put in place to ensure that documents stored on staff laptops are not lost when staff leave the business. Roll out of Aconex should address the retention of documents issue."
There was a very high turnover of staff on this project. During construction of the works seven different individuals held the role of PM. The project QS changed a similar number of times. The number of changes made to the occupants of these positions resulted in poor levels of documentation and hand over procedures that inhibited JMS’s ability to pursue variations and claims. It is recommended that:- • We strive to minimize staff turnover within our project delivery teams wherever possible. • JMS consider introducing staff bonuses linked to project completion on projects which are in remote locations and difficult to staff to reduce staff turnover on such projects. Note: Dependable Project Management provides a tool kit which may be used to facilitate effective handover between delivery team members. Use of this tool kit where staff hand overs are required during the delivery of the project should help to mitigate the impact of those staff changes.
"A Scottish quantity surveyor was redeployed from one of the Southern business to Beatrice. He was described as a capable resource who would appreciate the opportunity to move nearer home. Unfortunately, he did not perform once allocated to Beatrice. After consultation with HR and a short redeployment the QS was managed out of the business. It is recommended that staff who are not performing to the required standard should be performance managed by their line manager rather than simply passed on to another part of the business, where further damage will be caused by continued substandard performance."
Additional unnecessary labour costs were incurred on the project due to the deployment of labour which either: -  Did not have the requisite skill set; and/ or  Was not required for delivery of the project; or Was sourced from an agency on unattractive commercial terms. It is recommended that:-  we seek to improve management and utilization of direct labour resources. A business wide initiative is already in place for this.  A review of labour agency terms of engagement be carried out to avoid JMS being exploited when volume grows significantly.
"Management of Productivity No systems were put in place to set targets for, measure and manage productivity in real time. This meant that:- • Payments to our operatives were not linked to productivity achieved; • Key data required to support claims for loss of productivity due to Customer changes (e.g. winter working) was not collated. It is recommended that:- • Operatives earnings be linked to production achieved; • Step should be taken to ensure that detailed production records (diaries; labour allocation and daily outputs achieved) are maintained on every site. • Consideration be given to making sure that the PoAP report gives a % compliance for amount of site labour and plant that is recorded on allocation sheets • Consideration be given to imposing sanctions on production staff for failure to maintain the required records to the required standard."
"Programme JMS did not take a robust approach to preparation of the programme and updating the programme to take account of delay events particularly when production ramped down. This resulted in JMS: - • losing track of its performance relative to programme, changes to the critical path of the programme and its entitlements to extensions of time; and, • having to employ a specialist planner to prepare a detailed as built programme in order to understand and demonstrate the causes of delay to the critical path of the programme and its entitlement to an extension of time. JMS should ensure that it takes a consistent, contract compliant approach to preparation and updating of the programme on all of its projects to help ensure that it has a clear understanding of: - • Its’ plan for delivery of the scheme; • The cause(s) of delay; • The impact of those delays on the critical path of the programme; and, • Its’ entitlement(s) to extension of time and prolongation costs. JMS should review and look to strengthen and supplement the planning resource on projects where significant changes occur at an early stage to ensure that JMS put is best foot forward with the valuation of claims and variations in a timely manner."
Progression of crossing consents and legal agreements From the records that JMS was able to retrieve during investigation of the claims it appears that:- JMS did not take any action whatsoever to progress the consent required for the A96 crossing for a period of six months;  When it became apparent that a legal agreement would be required in order to progress the crossing to the A96 and that Nexan would take responsibility for this JMS failed to issue the requisite claim notification;  the Division of Responsibilities (DOR) included in the contract tied JMS to an obligation it could not deliver in relation to procuring consents and BAPAs from Network Rail; The first of these items contributed to the delay to availability of the consent required to construct the crossing; and the second of these items allowed NEXANs to time bar the potential delay claim associated with the requirement to obtain a legal agreement for the crossing and the time it took Nexans to so this. It is recommended that JMS:-  Maintain a schedule of consents required on all of its projects;  Ensure that all consents are pursued proactively as early as possible in the programme to minimize the risk that non availability of consents causes delay to the project; Ensure that all contractual notices are issued within the timescale required by the contract to avoid its claims being time barred.  Contract obligations for achieving site accesses are carefully reviewed to avoid obligations that we cannot deliver.
Travelling labour – 1 to 2 days production was lost per week due to labour travel time along with the fuel costs of extended mileage from England. This was not considered in the estimate. We need to consider the impact of working in remote locations on the cost of delivery at work winning stage. It is recommended that we review the labour sourcing strategy for each project during tender preparation and that we ensure that our bids allow for the cost / productivity impact of working in remote locations
"Failure to document tender change to drainage scope The tender documents included an obligation for JMS to provide permanent drainage. JMS’s offer was based on a revised lesser scope of drainage; however, the contract documents were not revised to reflect the purported omission from the scope. This meant that JMS had found itself with a contractual obligation to deliver the full scope of drainage described in the Employer’s Requirements for a reduced price. The financial impact of this issue was c£900K. This problem was compounded by the fact that the purported agreement with regard to the scope change was not recorded in writing. JMS was fortunate in that Nexans took a non-contractual approach to this issue which provided JMS with some relief in that Nexans offered to pay the extra over direct cost of providing the “additional scope”. They would not however pay for the additional programme time required to deliver the “additional scope” It is recommended that JMS seek to ensure all tender qualifications accepted by customers during contract negotiations are incorporated in the contracts in a way which renders them contractually effective;  all pre-contract correspondence with customers is captured in a centralized document control system so that it is available in the event of a subsequent dispute."
Agreement of Contract Terms. The terms and conditions of contract agreed with NEXANS left much to be desired and included a number of provisions that we should simply not have accepted. Examples of unsatisfactory contract provisions include but are not limited to:- • An inoperative EoT mechanism; • No entitlement to time or money in relation to events stemming from known interfaces with other contractors; • Condition Precedent provisions which required notice to be served within seven days of claim event or instruction giving rise to a variation; • An obligation to provide quotes for changes within a period of 5 days coupled with a denial of rights to have an information provided at a later date considered in the valuation of the change other than at Adjudication; • 5 Year defect liability period (DLP); extended by 2 years in respect of any defects which arise in DLP; • Performance Bond to be maintained until the end of the Warranty Period i.e. up to 7 years post completion. • 10% retention and performance bond (In place of on-demand bond). It is recommended that :- • JMS does not accept the risk associated with the interfaces with other contractors employed by clients in the contracts that it enters into; • JMS seeks to avoid extended warranty/ defect liability periods; • JMS ensures that the timescales incorporated in CP provisions included in client contracts are reasonable; • JMS seeks to avoid client requirement to extend the value of performance bonds to reflect the value of variations. It should be noted that the pre-construction gateways included in JMS’s procedures coupled with the deployment of dedicated pre construction commercial managers for contract review and tender support should minimise the risk of issues of this nature arising in future.
"Unable to locate executed version of contract. The M4 business unit was unable to locate an executed version of the Subcontract, and unable to confirm whether or not the Subcontract had been executed by JMS and Nexan. It is recommend that a check be put in place to ensure that:- • We know the signature status of all customer contracts; and; • all original executed contracts are held centrally and in Aconex"

"Access/egress signage blocked by barriers Gate affixed to steps, signage attached to gate. Review /Refine the TW criteria to eliminate minor no load bearing structures such as Boot Scrappers and such."
Installing anti-climb on towers. Training courses missed due to holidays. Training on winches. Always review holiday planner when accepting training course dates on behalf of the operatives.
Int/Ext plant hire sheets incorrect. Excavator delivered to site with incorrect bucket pins. Check and verify all plant sheets. Discrepancies queried and remedied as soon as distributed. Ensure critical H/S information such as HAV’s values and Noise Levels are included in delivery. Plant quarantined and inspected upon delivery. NCR raised against P&T.
"Subcontractors, not the easiest to manage/control/ensure quality etc. e.g. Arbus (the willow spilling/fencing subcontractor). Morgan marine not issuing certification for cast. JMC splashing taco on kerbs when completing tarmac works. Employ the specialist direct and JMS do the civil element. Employ the specialist direct and JMS do the civil element."
Site Managers Inspections not formally recorded. NCR issued after internal audit due to Competence Assessment Procedure not being applied fully. SMS not fully developed. Weekly Inspection form utilised Procedure followed. Register generated and maintained. Roles & Responsibilities generated and briefed. SMS developed and reviewed.
Q2 Negative observation regarding placement of concrete in line with T/SP/CE/1 and EWN about the same. 30 min window between placement of separate loads of structural concrete. C.O.C’s not in place for data books/CAST etc. Ensure correct revision drawings. Site instigated DCN’s. 50mm minimum under double leaf and sliding gates. Installing key-clamp on bases. Handles on gates not cranked (Lochrin & Bain ). Site concluded reducing pour sizes seemed the most efficient way to resolve this issue based upon many factors. Full review of concrete placement times and TQ to respond to EWN to be generated. Request these when placing orders and chase up in advance of required dates. Doc con/engineers to ensure only latest signed. approved drawings are in use/issued. Engineer to write DCN’s to ensure accuracy & after discussion with NG/Tech partners relevant personnel to make the process as efficient as possible. Engineer to ensure dimensions are correct. Don’t drill bolts to close to the top of the bases it brakes the concrete causing repairs which then requires a DCN for the new product. Install cranked handles that snap when you attempt to use as a climbing aid.
"Uncharted services discovered during excavation. Focus on HSG47 compliance. Slips, trips & falls on paving slabs/flags. Only trained & competent operatives to use column/tower winches. Safety Glasses/over spectacles. Additional ground radar survey undertaken. HSG47 compliance document produced and implemented. Work pack checklist developed and implemented. Barfaced (anti-slip) flags installed. Prevention of incidents. Ensure use of Area Hand over document to ensure acceptance and inspection by Tech Partner. Ensure all operatives wear safety glasses, prescription safety glasses can be obtained or over glasses must be worn to adhere to National Grids Safety Line Policy."
Mitigation fence. Incorrect materials in hazardous waste drums. Strim grass/vegetation adjacent to mitigation fence. Erected to protect surroundings. Checked daily to ensure condition. Inspection tags signed off daily as evidence of inspection. Improved layout and example photos and descriptions erected. This will make inspection/maintenance of fence easier.
Lochrin and Bain gate have access problems for cable Entry. Gate contact plates not fitted to the supplied Lochrin bain gates. L and B gates need to take into account the the access problems and provide clearer openings for the cable. All contacts and plate details need to be supplied to Lochrin Bain so they can incorporate within Manufacture. This will prevent the need for drilling and welding on site.
Altron towers do not have sufficient cable capacity within frame tubing to accommodate both lighting and towers. Chubb need to ensure that they have incorporated this issue within the design. If towers not suitable they need to speak with Altron about different models.
SCO 1 and 2 issues. We can not get people on the database despite all requirements being met .Continue to stress to national Grid the importance of ensuring people are on the database. This will prevent works going forward if the client does not co-operate.
Red line Mark ups and change control management is getting lost as the project progresses. Change control needs to be managed and ongoing through the scheme. Drawings to be submitted to NG as early as possible once sections are complete.
Early Site establishment Do not commence until access to a full site facility is available. JMS tried to take a positive approach at Samlesbury to push on with the works but a lack of understanding from NG in regards restrictions made it very difficult to operate.
"The programme was achieved which was civil handover for the end of December; currently we are acting as PC on the contract and have commenced with the demobbing. We achieved the mentioned project in the correct time scale and in budget, with profit by constant monitoring of labour and vehicles, plant and materials, also by holding constant in house meetings between my site team, and with regular liaising and visits from senior management. My biggest positive advice to take forward would be a diligent and proactive foreman, historically and ongoing the role of a site manager on a NG job or most other company’s and contracts these days is to liaise with the company and the client and sub-contractors via endless paper work and meetings. Which sometimes produces a short fall in managing construction activities, this is where a diligent foreman steps in, i do believe we lack in that on certain sites, with some quality and the way certain projects are ran, out of sequence not finishing as we go etc., I believe this needs to be addressed via training course etc."
"Surveying and setting out testing and inspecting. Construction methods. I believe we should implement a design which should suit all depending on the given area and ground conditions of course, the way to achieve this would be hold a meeting and design a blue print and stick to it, also input from yard and store men would be essential. I believe we pretty much have this covered by the luxury of a onsite engineer, as most are fully aware of all the testing of concrete and inspection etc., however a meeting amongst engineers may not go a miss to see if we are short falling anywhere with equipment etc. I believe we should all hang our coat on the finish as you go method of constructing, with such a pedantic client as NG or any client for that matter, we shouldn’t have large areas of ground open without completing as we go, which also closes out hazards and becomes a more manageable site from a construction and health and safety point of view."
"Better MTO at design would help as I believe the ones produced don’t highlight all long lead items, to achieve this a early meeting at design with the site manager and some input from purchasing will be required. Also and most importantly I do believe we need a bigger choice of material suppliers and specialists whom supply and manufacture our products, with the recent issues with building hardening products kiosks and the like, could we look elsewhere in Europe perhaps?, we are in the 21st century. I believe this is still a grey area between ourselves as a company we all seem to be singing of separate hymn sheets, different sites have different little files with red lines in etc. and different registers which we keep getting pulled on from NG. Way forward again would be a meeting lead by our design manger with a system and blue print that suits all and we stick to it throughout the country. I believe keeping sub-contractors to a minimum apart from certain activities i: e building hardening and specialist trades is a must. I believe it’s the back bone of this company, and is and always has been appealing to our customers and puts us ahead of our competitors."
"Temporary works. Another point which I believe we have addressed and are managing very well, with the tagging system etc. set up, we do seem to be singing off the same hymn sheet with this one. Downfall when we act as PC I believe we don’t leave a TWS or TWC or anyone qualified in post, as even as PC we still have a duty of care with establishment temporary structures steps, cabin founds, signage etc., are we leaving ourselves open?"
"Ensuring all staff has the correct competences can be a mind field. Labour. As mentioned adjourning i think we are tackling this as a company, and we have a good training team set up with Debs at ISS and the girls in Golborne, with this in place and on site matrixes I think we can control this. Again I have covered this on actions going forward above with the subcontract statement, perhaps more monitoring of labour at site level to ensure each site doesn’t carry any unwanted labour which could drain resources, I think weekly meetings are essential for this to happen."
"The on hiring and off hiring is getting there and I can see an improvement in my time here, however we have still received plant uncertified at times which can’t happen and shouldn’t happen perhaps we should, instantly quarantine everything without certs and suspend payments to the P&T department. Which I know we should be doing but “do we all do this” when we are desperate and have been awaiting kit?"
"I believe the requesting format works well, however more notice on long lead items from our buying dept. should be given, we are all aware of the main one’s fence etc. however the small ones can catch you out. Once you’ve placed the order no more contact is made until you receive them which could be longer than you think, so perhaps more warning on long lead items from the buying dept. would be an advantage. Managing materials is important simply double checking drawings etc. will and should ensure no surplus or wasted materials. Do we cover this correctly? We still seem to be getting below par fence and gates through the net, is it time we ISS employ our own quality inspector whom can check the quality at source? It is important we have a good trained and interested store/yard man on every job from a health and safety point of view with materials being stored correctly, but also from a commercial point of view with the correct handling of supplies and materials. And again i believe it’s another one of our traits that’s become expectant of our clients."
Lead times & purchasing Management / supervision of (including communication) Competence & Experience as pointed out above we do need more of a choice in subcontractors especially on the specialist side of the business. A good point is i believe our current labour and security subcontractors are very good in ensuring competences are correct and forwarded over etc.
"With a lot of these control systems I believe we are very good at, regular meetings with the site QS should be kept going, and the QS being stationed on site especially the larger ones is extremely beneficial and has been on this contract. I personally commented on the site manger being involved more at the tendering and estimating stage for me it has been happening, so yes all positive from me with these systems of the business."
"I don’t believe I have issued any NCRS on this contract I have had some small quality issues with gates etc. which I dealt with at site level and gained a quick repose from the supplier. However, I suppose a stricter approach moving forward would be beneficial to advances in up and coming projects regarding the improvement of quality so that would be my own lesson learned."
"Again as above I think we should have a blue print for site set ups which could be a good lesson learned. One negative I believe the temporary ground hog units we hire at the very start or at trail hole stage are very inadequate , could we or the P&T dept. source and even purchase some of our own? ."
Thankfully we have had no such incidents. A good lesson learned would be ensure good access to environmental check points to ensure constant and regular monitoring can be achieved.
"PC ROLE, the whole concept of this role needs to be readdressed. I believe this is also a grey area, i know the procedure is just to leave normally the SHE advisor on site after construction actives have been executed. But this is causing problems as I believe the site manger “especially on larger contracts” should stay on to carry the role out, if this doesn’t happen we get calls and called back constantly anyway to deal with snagging and problems etc.. This on some of the larger more value contracts is inevitable despite how good the site is completed, with problems that can’t be dealt with by a SHE advisor e.g. blocked ducts other unforeseen system failures. Also we need to send men up to service welfare dieseling up e.g. regular can we not just put this price in from day one and claim for a say manager or advisor and one op? Also there is the above temporary works topic whom checks the temporary works if the engineer or site manager as left?, we will still be responsible for many items requiring temporary works control toilet steps, cabin founds, satellites, fencing barriers etc, in the establishment area just a thought......."

Hub day held on site (inc subbies) Proper site specific induction; Good exclusion zones in place; Nobody allowed on the viaduct who wasn’t working;  full time H&S ensured HSQE remained at the forefront of people’s minds. No JMS novices on site during critical time- Subbies did but were well managed by JMS regarding HSQE Going forward we need to insist on the subbies providing names and quails prior to attendance and get them trained prior to blockade  HSQE Meetings with key subbies to highlight our expectations prior to them sending lads to site.
"Wasn’t done as planned • Changed the concreting plan during the construction phase as we realized we couldn’t bottom pump the concrete the entire length with the amount of hard standing areas available .• With hindsight we should have ensured adequate access for pumps and wagons and enough hard standings to allow us to pump the length of the viaduct • Get buying teams out to site and run them through the concrete supply requirements so they can see the importance • Concrete pump operators were working under TVP’s and we had to very carefully monitor their hours as they did not have contingency drivers available- need to ensure we have adequate resources available going forward and that when pumping concrete from the bottom, the pump op should have had a crane controller when working near OLE"
We can do attitude • Good support and communication between shifts • Everyone approached the job with a positive mindset • Had a number of individuals and leaders who displayed positive behaviors and led by example to keep morale up. • Retention of the teams allowed everyone to understand the personalities and drivers within the shift teams • Staying together in the hotel allowed everyone to build morale.
"Boom of the concrete pump made contact with the OLE and RC and pulled it down • Operative did not open and set the boom in the correct sequence • Controller had been sent to compound B to await further instruction and had not received the task briefing before commencing setting up • Operative was trying to set up to give a head start, but in reality shouldn’t have (and shouldn’t have been allowed to) proceed to the point of lifting the boom into position without receiving correct instruction and supervision. • Consider the possibility that in future have had a form C authorisations in place • Need a robust procedure in place going forward- we were so focused on what was happening on the track/ viaduct we didn’t keep control of the surrounding zones • Bring in the op ahead of time in future to ensure adequate brief • Consider the Need for a crane controller and a robust RAMS in place to ensure this doesn’t happen again • Having NWR on site was a positive as they could understand the difficulty and were supportive- having told us in advance to speak up if we were to hit the overhead • New procedure/ permit being implemented by JMS for overhead pumping."
"Quality and speed and methodology was as per the programme if not improved. For the screening operation, control the amount of sand placed in the excavation – too much in one place is counterproductive.  Implement the same engineering controls which worked well; If we bring in sand by train again, control on site and education of the delivery as to where and when we want it dropping; Have a contingency for sand to ensure we don’t get caught with less than we need; JMS supervision of subcontract staff to ensure we dig to correct formation levels."
Resources unavailable local to the worksite (the compound was a significant way from the viaduct and it was not feasible to have refreshments/ WC’s located up on the length of the viaduct). Sense of competition between shifts to get the most work done led to teams wanting to work through breaks.  Have either a staggered rotation to ensure proper breaks or a if possible a welfare resource local to the working areas to allow refreshments etc. Have food provided and waiting for teams in the compound Getting the details of the van Storey used a Peover to provide refreshments. Need to force breaks if a sense of competition creeps in where ops would rather continue.
Great mobilization times from Plant and Transport when we really needed it. Support from Resource ops was great. Plant fitters and plant ops turned up to site with a great attitude. Leadership team reinforcing the importance of this scheme to the wider Golborne teams. Focused attention from the teams as they appreciated the importance of what we were delivering. Other site and project managers supported the scheme well and provided resources where required. Cross-hired plant was well managed.
"Programme activities of the supply chain slipped and the perception was that JMS didn’t drive them enough • We didn’t have the experience or knowledge of the P[1]Way elements of the works methodology, to be able to drive the programme as we did not have the expertise available within the JMS team. • Closer subcontract management and review of their planned shift patterns • Hold the subcontractor responsible for adhering to/ providing competent resource at tender stage • We need a supervisor who has a knowledge of P-Way to oversee that element of the works: we were doing what we thought was right with a very limited knowledge • Identify any issues with the subcontract shift patterns prior to the block • Make it clear who is in charge and who everybody is at induction"
Plan/Do/Review meetings held early which highlighted responsibilities. 3 locations of compounds identified early. Hub day allowed the whole team to understand the importance of the job and the programme. Compounds/ walkways/ exclusion zones- need to ensure they are big enough. Ensuring we have the resource available to do the up-front works. Providing the wider JMS with advanced notice of the resource requirements and programme to ensure we can service all of the projects to the benefit of the entire CP5 portfolio. Stringent adjudication process needs to be implemented for subcontractors.
• Historical issue we find on most blockades • Concrete pump drivers and NWR visitors on site under TVP’s • Visitors turning up without TVP’s expecting to be let on site .• No TVP- not allowed on site[1]regardless of employer • Make preference to subbies who are PTS and link-up approved • Ensure contingency operatives are available and this is written into the contract • Ensure rostering of subcontract labour allows for contingency and to ensure people are never in a position to have to choose between work over hours or adhere to programme • We need to dictate the number of hours which we need concrete pumps to be pumping and ensure the subbie has adequate resource to manage them • The planning and booking of specialist personnel who require TVPs needs to be carried out better – ask the right questions.
"Programme of works was up revved due to J Murphy & Sons not having an early intervention meeting with the Network Rail’s Construction manager meant a delay in agreeing the total amount rivets to be replaced, which meant scaffolding being erected for longer than planned, thus requiring further possessions. Early intervention with Network Rail (NR) Construction Manager (CM) may have eliminated the delay in replacement of rivets."
"Construction phase altered midway through the construction process. Initially NR DPE stated all steelwork repairs had to be done, prior to construction the new highway slab, but this changed as NR realized it would add extra time to the original programme. Discuss in detail any constraints with the NR Designated Project Engineer (DPE) in the presence of the NR Project Team, which may prevent similar engineering controls being overcome."
"There was no designer in place when the contract was awarded to J Murphy & Sons, due to the fact that Birse Rail Consulting were no longer trading and thus no CAD files or designer was in place to answer any technical queries, CDG were appointed at a later date. Ensure a Designer is in place prior to starting works allowing for quick responses to TQ’s."
"Maintaining an access for a 3T weight limit over the structure whilst carrying out construction of the new concrete highway slab, this was achieved by JMS TW team designing a temporary bridge. Agreeing any TWP prior to starting on site works, which may have allowed for the private land owner being paid to stay away for a couple of days, for the concrete works to take place without TWP being required. Discuss with all parties via an early pre[1]construction site meet."
"Labour, Staff. Competence, Training, Experience. All satisfactory on this particular project."
"‘Site to Site’ transfer notes being lost or kept unwittingly by operatives, instead of being handed to management for file transfer to Golborne yard, resulting in additional on-hire costs. Bring out and brief a best practice relating to procedures for on & off-hiring plant, as quite a few operatives are unaware of commercial implications relating to lost or delayed yard returns for ‘site to site’ transfer notes."
APB Construction UK were proactive on all fronts and would be an excellent sub-contractor on future schemes.
JMS had to resolve land access agreements and arrange for payment to 3rd Party Land Owner .Network Rail to resolve the land access issues prior to their contractor setting up site compound and starting works.
"Excellent site Set-up that served 2 GB&P schemes, thus demonstrating efficiency with a lower than normal carbon footprint."
All lead paint waste was controlled by APB with JMS receiving copies of waste transfer notes.
"When the initial programme was produced it included an element of working during mid-week nights. The works was originally planned and priced to be done this way but this work was effectively wasted as working midweek nights on this line was not possible as already known by some of the site team from previous experiences. The main element of the works were undertaken during Rules of the Route ROR possessions which were published as being 8 hours long. In reality average working time achieved during possessions was 3½ hours making progress very slow as by the time the site was established, very little work could be done before it needed to be handed back. On one instance during scaffold installation everything that was being erected had to be taken down in the same shift as there was insufficient time to get it to the stage that it would be made safe for the passage of trains. These problems were highlighted to the NR team repeatedly with a proposal to postpone the works but the decision was made to carry on which resulted in a protracted programme and increased cost to the project as a whole. The decision was eventually taken to complete approximately 60% of the works and pull off site. A return in the future to complete will be necessary but better rail access will need to be developed to deliver the works. Include the allocated site manager and other members of the delivery team on the development of the programmes. Refer to site management who have worked on the same line previously for their experiences of rail access times. Communicate to the wider Murphy team the challenges of working on this line and the reduced working time available. Learn from the issues with the 1st phase of the works and plan to be more efficient during phase 2 by only returning during much improved rail access opportunities."
"Once the issues with limited working time were highlighted, the rail planning team identified an alternative way of taking the isolation by planning the switching to take place at Warrington instead of Preston. This saved 1 hour but ultimately was only implemented on one occasion due to difficulties in planning the different isolation arrangements with the NR OLE team as it affected other worksite dependencies. Brief the rail planning team on the possibility of implementing this option for future schemes on this line with similar risks of limited time on site. With more upfront planning with the NR OLE team, the isolation can be taken sooner resulting in more working time on site."
"The scheme was undertaken as a build only scheme as the design had previously been undertaken by Birse under the previous framework agreement with Network Rail. Post grit blast inspections usually undertaken with the designer had to take place with the Network Rail Project Engineer and where repairs were deemed necessary, no designer was in place to detail the design of such repairs. Repair details were developed from the experience of the Murphy team together with the experience of the subcontractor APB and proposed to NR in the form of TQ’s. Although the NR PE signed these off, he was reticent to do this as he was not the original designer for the works. This led to and concerns from the Network Rail team about who would retain liability for the proposed repair details. Murphy CEM, CRE and design manager to highlight to Network Rail that on all future similar build only schemes, NR will retain design responsibility and liability. If the NR engineering team are unhappy about this arrangement, a designer will need to be allocated and a design verification of the original design will need to be carried out."
Murphy site team and APB very proactive and collaborative when proposing repair details for the steel work. Continue to foster a collaborative working environment with our supply chain and promote the positive results that this can deliver. The Technical Query process was adhered to and managed well by the CRE and was seen as an efficient way of implementing change control. Promote the benefits of implementing robust Technical Query controls and how when used well this process can be a very comprehensive way of implementing change control.
"The site compound has to be downsized due to unknown neighboring works by another contractor and then eventually had to be relocated to another location. During the installation of wireless traffic lights over the bridge, the traffic lights were the subject to repeated faults. Closer investigation revealed that another similar set of lights being used by a separate contractor out of eyesight but within range of the Murphy Traffic lights were switched to the same frequency and both sets of lights were interfering with each other and causing faults. Recommend that the preconstruction team liaise with the site delivery Project Manager and pursue compound space sufficient for the project needs without undue compromise. Communicate to the wider murphy team that when using wireless traffic lights there is a chance of interference by similar equipment within range. For future wireless traffic light installations, a check should be carried out of similar installations within a sensible distance of the site. Where this is identified, liaison with the other contractor should take place to make sure different frequencies are being used."
"The GBP package was subcontracted to include the installation of the scaffold, this was seen to work effectively as the main GBP subcontractor was responsible for any issues with the scaffold Consider using this approach again on future similar schemes."
"Site delivery team remained the same for the duration of the works with morale on site consistently high despite the issues. The adoption of the Feedback Friday scheme was seen as a success – It was generally agreed that this forum gave all site operatives a platform to contribute to the delivery of the works and that their ideas and suggestions made the site operatives take greater ownership of the works including the health and safety environment that the works was to be delivered in. This also applied to subcontractors. The scaffold subcontractor JFE Attridge working directly for our subcontractor APB was seen and working to a high standard and with a very good attitude to safety and programme. Continue to promote the positive effect of setting up a core delivery team for the whole duration of the works. This has led to a consistent site team familiar with the works, the compound and plant arrangements. Promote the positive effects of the Feedback Friday scheme."
"The attitude to safety exhibited by the GBP subcontract operatives and the scaffold operatives was very good. HAVS control set up on site was seen to be very good and well maintained. Records of operative’s exposure to construction equipment was monitored well and available on site. Communicate this positive feedback to the supply chain and recommend the use of the GBP subcontractor and this scaffolders on future schemes. Continue to set up the same good HAVS controls and ensure the records are available on site for regular inspection, this will give our client confidence in our control procedures."
The bridge was the site of a past fatality and had a commemorative board for the deceased. Murphy site team track down the family of the deceased and consult them prior to dismantling and relocating the commemorative board/plaque for which the family were very grateful. Continue to promote 3rd party/community liaisons and communicate to the wider Murphy team that when done well we will receive good feedback from the local community.
The blasting and painting inspections were carried out by Andy McGurk – these were seen as being very thorough and gave our client confidence in our site controls. The final quality of the product was very good. Recommend the use of Andy McGurk for inspections on future GBP works and commend the site team on a good quality installation.
"The programme for the reinstatement of the tracks was not realistic, it takes 3 – 4hrs to pull the first track down and then the RRV’s need to run on the first line to drag the second line in. Issues were created with the dumper as it suffered a puncture and we then lost time looking for another dumper. The use of the 13T excavator c/w cam lock did not look or feel right and it was not covered in the paperwork. Alex Pike from NR told the project just before the weekend that we were not allowed to use the rail in the compound despite previous agreements. There was a change of staff with NR Local Ops which was unfortunate at the time and it caused last minute panic but no delay to the works."
"Core Team – 3 out of 4 NR staff reports raised concerns about co-ordination issues on site, Joelle asked us to gain feedback from the Core Team for comments on how they were managed and to see if they could bring any better ideas. Rob Higgins commented on G Miller’s proactive approach, the good site compound and the way works were arranged. FK raised concerns about paperwork and sign off times, last minute.com submission of WPP/TBS and poor quality TBS’s that lacked detail. P Shrader mentioned that overall the project was a major improvement on School Lane and the team can be proud of their efforts, there was concerns about a 4 or 5hrs over run but the team performed excellently to only have a 25min over run which created no issues within the higher levels of NR and this was a major positive to the NR/JMS teams. The works last weekend in Week 52 for the welding & tamping was a major success and a major relief to NR and congratulated the team on the efforts. FK suggested we can get J Moore to manage this and lead workforce engagement. This in future can take the form of a white board meeting so each Ganger understands what they are doing and to ensure they understand if they are on programme etc."
"System of waterproofing and ballast retention units – interface between the deck and the ballast retention units was complex. There was a lack of leadership and knowledge with these works but the team worked well to get these installed however it took twice as long to complete compared to the programme. National Grid Gas – issues only arose on the Wed or Thurs before the core weekend, the need for trial holes to expose the pipe at the start of the possession and the fact that large holes were open on either side affected the plant movements especially RRV’s from one side to the other. The last minute reduction in permissible weight of the SPMT/Deck meant we had to take 40T of ballast off the deck which then lost us some time getting new ballast into place."
Matt Clarke covered the use of 6N as backfill along the full length of the units but in the design it was only meant to be used under the retention units. The requirement for back of wall drains is a requirement for the NR RAM. JMS seem to think this was raised as a TQ before the works for agreement to use 6N. We need to review this item on each job.
"13T Excavator break down on Chinley side of the works, was there JMS fitter cover on call as it took 3hrs for the Fitter to get to site. where did had no direct effect on the critical path it will have had an effect on bulk excavation for back of wall drainage and laying PC units which could have saved 1.5hrs. Safety Critical Staffing: Issues with M O’Connor on Sun night, P Shrader queried why we did not have our own SSOW staff on site – need to avoid agency staff in future. Need to ensure we have an on-site Fitter present & can we clarify what the issue was as it took 5mins to fix once the Fitter arrived on site. Need to avoid agency staff in future."
"There was an issue with lifting chains as the same chains/lifting eyes were being used by the Hi-Ab on the road and then the 13T excavator at track level, if we had 2 sets of lifters then we could have saved at least 10mins per units which was nearly 2hrs. F Weir commented about the use of VORTOK fencing for screed rails as it took 3.5hrs to do the screed. The total amount of excavation on either side of the structure was not excavated/removed enough during the initial dig, more should have been taken out before driving in the new bridge to reduce the amount of “back of wall” excavation works later as the major issue was getting the muck away once the deck was in. There was only 1 dumper on either side to remove approx. 50T of additional spoil however these dumpers were also helping Stobart to move ballast. The first section of rail should have been flame cut but the Stobart burner/lance would not work so it was actually cut using a clamped Stihl saw which is against the Standard detail as the first cut should always be flame cut. FK discussed the future use of 6” x 2” timbers fixed to the face of the brickwork to act as screed rails, and then tubes to the rear. The screed compacts by 5 – 8mm underweight so we could add a fillet strip to get the screed to level and then remove it before landing the bridge."
"Stobart were short on staff in the last shift – mainly due to the fact that they were due to be complete in the Sunday day shift – we discussed that even if Stobart are not meant to be on site that in future we should plan in some resources from them so we have continuity. NR had issues with the fact that Stobart knew on Sunday morning that things were 5 or 6hrs behind and that they should have reacted with additional resources to ensure we could recover the situation. Apparently the calls were made at 5pm Sun rather than 10am Sun and we need to review this going forward. Danger was created to JMS guys as they got involved with pulling in rails and materials, and were not aware of the tools and techniques and the H&S risks. Triple wacker plate – seemed to be competence/training issues with the Stobart guy using it on the Up Line – do we have copies of his tickets as the S&T guys stopped and showed him how to use it? Tampers: Amey Sersa tamper ran through the points at Hazel Grove and turned up 3.5hrs late at Redhouse Lane, it was agreed that their shift could be extended by NSC but the ES had a row with them and they changed their minds and left site without doing any works for JMS. The Babcock tamper crew worked beyond their hours to help get the job done. Having the ODM Phil Berthenshaw on site was great, he came on site as the word got out via Control that JMS were looking for ballast and thanks to NR Andy Hannah & NR Simon Tillett for their help in sourcing ballast. P Shrader had concerns about the motivation of Stobart’s Martin Straughan on Sun evening as he seemed to lack motivation. P Shrader - queried the packer plates and lift plates used by Stobart and the general P way issues and P Shrader wants a response from Stobart on why they did not have the correct materials on site. Pete also wants to know where we lost the 4hrs on the Sat night shift after the bridge had been installed as this will be a critical activity for Doxey Brook on the WCML. The planned JMS tamper was on the Down Line and then we had to agree with the Signaller as the Points for the crossover was outside our work site and this lost some time. Issues raised over the fact that we had 2 tampers originally and then one was lost, and later we got a favour from Amey Sersa to use theirs but we should not have been reliant on this. JMS will also need to invest in additional P Way CRE’s to cover the work load going forward as J Winstanley can only be on one site."

"Track Cutting & Welding - the cuts changed early in the OROR but this information was not relayed to the Stobart Supervisor on the last shift, R Higgins was her on Fri night and he mentioned that the Stobart supervisor was only then issued with the revised welding plan (issued by J Winstanley..?) and cuts were incorrectly marked out on site? This was corrected on site with the help of Rob Higgins before any cuts were carried out, closure rails were moved into position on the correct side of the structure however R Higgins advised the team that we moved the wrong sections of rail."
"What was bad from F Weir included the screeding methods, running out of ballast and being at least 150T short as this caused panic and took peoples focus off the main works, Per Way staff leaving site with no contingency, lighting was poor with only 2 VT1 around the bridge, lighting poor on SPMT, fish plates and shims incorrect, FK to forward photos to P Shrader from N McLennon. The local TME really kicked off on Monday with regards to the quality of the track hand-back and he even stated he was surprised we did not have a de[1]railment A materials register will be required in future to include spares to ensure we have all the correct materials on site – this list needs to be reviewed by the JMS Track CRE and in future do we have Rob Higgins on the last shift to ensure everything is compliant."
SPMT was badly lit and once the new deck was installed it became very dark under the structure – we need to add lights to the abutments such as festoon lights and even add lights to the soffit of the new bridge/SPMT so we avoid this issue. There was also small amounts of spoil left at road level on either side which delayed the drive in as the underfoot conditions were poor for ALE Operator. Rhiannon Price - raised concerns about the site briefing and induction – too generic but discussed that the site induction was a compliance item. R Price also mentioned different people with different rules/PPE consistency/walking routes and people taking short cuts by the cabins rather than using the designated walking routes and this may have been caused by poor lighting along the walkway and the tripping hazards with the trough lids/ballast shoulders. We need a separate marked up drawing(s) to indicate the high risk activities/plant movements/activities for that shift/points of contact/etc – discussed that we can use the white board and then over lay with clear layout drawings/site plans/diagrams to highlight risks and activities for that particular shifts.
Discussed that the NR S&T teams were excellent and performed really well over the weekend for us without causing any delay or issues. F Weir commented that S&T and E+P were excellent as they originally wanted 3hrs wheels free but actually took 40mins and they were excellent in supporting the project and working around us all.
"Disruptives booked for 4 weekends in November in a notorious location for snow and poor weather. Heavy rainfall meant sodden ground, additional maintenance/stone to temp works and access roads etc. During the Pre-Construction phase, the project management of the scheme changed hands three times (for various valid reasons). However this regular change lost precious planning time and promoted instability within the project right from the outset. In general, the programme was correct and in the main, worked to until the later stages of the project. Despite the weather and ground conditions, the project was delivered with a “Can Do” attitude. We need to be stronger with NR when it comes to accepting risk/liability for core weekends secured in areas of notoriously inclement weather (ie. Todmorden, Buxton etc). Estimators to consult weather data at this sites during estimating/ATC submission stage and manage the risk with NR accordingly. PM to be selected at receipt of remit and, unless the circumstances for change are unavoidable, that PM and team are to remain as the constant throughout."
"Designer (CGD) would not listen to our buildability advice when it came to the bank seat detail (we wanted mini-piles but CDG refused and wouldn’t accept that mass fill wasn’t the best solution). Rockhead meant Temp Works couldn’t be used which led to a dangerous situation with vertical faces above personnel. CDG omitted a lot of detail (ie. stair nosings, anti-slip on lower sections, PCC and tie-ins etc) which led to delay, TQ’s and issues with procurement. CDG stated to use Standard Details, but they weren’t applicable. Despite the weather and the poor, borderline unbuildable design, the project was delivered to a high standard. Refuse to deliver projects on H&S grounds. Ensure Design Verification on Build Only schemes is completed. Future Buildability Reviews at GRIP 3 and GRIP 5 need to get into the nitty-gritty of the detail, rather than just concentrating on the high level, big ticket items. Involve the right, construction phase personnel early enough in the design phase to ensure buildability input is proactive rather than too late to influence."
"There was a challenge to say that the footbridge wasn’t actually required at all. There was an underbridge a couple of hundred yards away which could be used instead, meaning this asset could have been taken out of use. Why was a bespoke design used at this location when a Standard Detail would have sufficed? Work with NR in the early GRIP stages to assess feasibility and be stronger when it comes to pushing for project removal. Granted, it removes work from our annual turnover figures but KPI scoring and positive feedback to the RAM would counter-act this. As above for Build Only schemes. For D&B, we need to get our CRE’s and PM’s taking account of this approach during GRIP 2-3."
"Haul Road required to move us from the compound to the structure. Tight area, on a steep gradient with S&T present. Resulted in a complicated TW Design which took more stone and work/time than we anticipated. Heavy rain and subsequent flooding washed a lot of the road material away, meaning we spent time/money not only topping it up but reinforcing with bog mats. Then we had to remove it, which again took more time/cost than anticipated. Also had cost associated with cleaning up the washout (sweepers etc). Earthworks TW for the bank seat. We didn’t allow any TW at all in order to install the bank seat. The original intention was to dig it our and work underneath a 3m vertical face, which was a H&S and CDM issue. As a solution we engaged a local geotechnical consultant at our own cost to assess the excavation and provide advice and a way forward. We agreed with NR that some TW Designs didn’t require their approval as they didn’t affect trains or pedestrians. PM commented that the TW Design for the ramp was practical and a good design. TW Design was carried out post-submission of the ATC, meaning the allowance for TW within our ATC was nowhere near the quantity it should have been. We allowed for £18k and 150 tonnes of stone. In reality it cost £25k and we imported over 500 tonnes. In future, TW Design to be integrated with permanent works to ensure we can not only make commercial considerations but also ensure that perm works and TW are joined up. Similar to the above, ensure that TW Design is integrated and reviewed in conjunction with the permanent works. Also utilise the principles of “Safe by Design” to look to minimise the amount of TW by increasing/changing permanent works details as needed."
"The project lost £120k on labour alone. The resource levels provided by Ops at ATC submission were not appropriate and far too light. For example, we priced for 4 men for 9 weeks when in reality we had more like 8 men full time, plus additional labour for the core weekends. Works elsewhere were caped therefore the project ended up being told to carry additional and unrequired labour resource. Similarly with off[1]hiring labour, tried to remove from site but told they had nowhere to go so site were told to keep them and carry their cost. All core weekends fully/well resourced. Slight issue with plant op availability but external agencies provided as required. Links back to the original price submission and the resource allocation to the project. Virtually everyone on the site stayed in lodge and those costs were not allowed for. Liaise closely with the Labour Manger to provide as much notice as possible when off-hiring labour."
£20k spent on vans because external hired vans were used as opposed to internal. We had two rail projects in Todmorden and P&T booked plant and vans to this job instead of the other one. However the proper process was not followed and therefore credits could not be gained from P&T.v Lift Supervisors had to be externally hired and brought in on TVP’s as we don’t have sufficient resource with this competence in-house. All craneage used on this job was internal. Our plan was amended slightly to keep this element in-house. Crane Lift Plan delivered and approved in-house. Site Managers and Foreman to be more vigilant when it comes to checking Live Hire sheets and following process when on/off-hiring. Possible solution is to link the van to the person so both get booked in at the same time rather than separately. Train more personnel with this competence.
"Lack of detail around the smaller ticket items on the design meant the clarification process was delayed meaning materials could not be procured as per programme, leading to delay. Designer CDG nominated a lot of suppliers meaning we had to single source a lot of items. Support from our procurement department was commented on as being very good. Historically drawings that refer to “use Standard Details” don’t get included within our Procurement Schedule and they need to be. Involve the QS’s more in this. Develop the “End of GRIP 5 Buildability Review “ into a full day to plan the scheme and complete the Procurement Schedule, discuss and record staff/labour /plant allocations etc. Get involved earlier in Build Only schemes to offer alternative solutions and suppliers to the Designer."
"Performance by all sub[1]contractors was very good, and nothing negative. Subcontractor Evaluation Questionnaire to be completed for each supplier as part of the lessons Learned process."
"Five Change Requests submitted to date and as of 28 April 2016 (Practical Completion achieved 18 December) only one CR has been agreed to date. Project overspent by circa £200k. Paul Kelly stated that Ryan Wilson (Trainee QS) did a very good job. Commercial losses centre around the lack of construction phase personnel at planning & pricing stage, but also the effect of the weather and associated flooding on the site. Better planning, estimating and resource allocation needed at the outset. In terms of the build phase, better forecasting required, with more regular visits to site needed by the QS."
"Wrong concrete placed in pile cap. Should have been a C50 and ended up pouring a C40. Delivery ticket from batching plant was only checked after pour had been completed. The call-off order was correct but the batching misheard the verbal order for this specific order and sent the wrong concrete. The touching up of the structure was done to such a poor standard that all of the internal faces of the parapets had to be repainted. Brickwork on the bank seat was commented on as looking excellent. In general, the quality was good despite the cold and wet conditions. JMS QMS procedure, in particular our Concrete procedure, to be adhered to. Also, feedback in the session on the QMS was that new starts (and most long term employees) aren’t familiar with all of our procedures and as such some of them do not get implemented. Could the key procedures be briefed/rolled out via a hard copy manual to all? Or could the key standards be uploaded to the new Murphy app so all sites have instant access to them even when they don’t have internet access/signal?"
"The original plan was for the generated 50t of site Won material to be removed from site, and the saturated condition of the ground meant more had to be removed. We also generated more spoil than initially anticipated due to the additional excavation for the bank seat and the Furthermore, the spoil was contaminated with Himalayan Balsam and the cost to dispose escalated massively from what had been priced for. Washout from the stone road/ramp created a potential environmental issue which needed to be monitored. Also meant road sweepers had to be brought it at additional cost. Re-used some of the masonry from the demolished pier. Reinstated the access road to the residents property on the other side of the railway. Relationship with them was generally positive."
"Works completed 1.5 weeks ahead of time. Japanese Knotweed hampering progress onsite. Works accelerated to increase productivity, progress and reduce time on site. Good relationship and regular communications with property owner thereby enabled scope for increased productivity and progress. Full assessment of the extents of Japanese Knotweed encroachment on site works was not undertaken prior to commencement of works. Mitigation measures reactive instead of proactive."
"No dedicated setting out engineer for the project. ALO working procedures and controls. Setting out engineer availability and resourcing very problematic and onerous. No allocated setting out engineer for the project. ALO working procedures and controls clearly identified, good level of support and feedback enabling revision of planned works where necessary resulting in no down time/ time lost."
"Soil nail design not agreed/. signed off prior to commencement of works. Access for soil nailing works poorly conceived at design/ pre-construction stage. Confusion of design of soil nail responsibility due to specialist soil nailing activities being subcontracted by JMS designer to specialist soil nailing contractor. Situation led to cross over of information, lines of communication became convoluted and unclear. Tight confines of site coupled with extremes of working radii resulted in the need for 2no long reaches of differing capacities to be used. This led to down time during swop over and setting up of the nailing rig, additional temporary works and multiple road closures to enable access/ egress."
"Temporary works delivery. Poor scaffold design. Temporary works execution and control onsite very good. Suitably qualified personnel onsite. Scaffold design did not consider site conditions, confines and buildability of scaffold and permanent works design. Scaffold design required revision to achieve acceptable solution."
"High level of competence of JMS & subcontract personnel. Works undertaken as planned, no delays incurred due to inadequate training or competence of personnel."
"Plant insufficient to undertake works. Plant supply. Tight confines of site coupled with extremes of working radii dictated very specific long reach capabilities. Specific plant was sourced and ordered by site well in advance of works to satisfy capacity requirements, incorrect plant ordered by P&T. Poor feedback, acknowledgement and communication by P&T. Condition of delivered plant extremely good. All nearly new with correct and present certification."
Materials requisitioned and delivered in good time. Controlled/ contaminated waste disposal inadequate. All materials necessary to undertake and deliver site works requisitioned and delivered in good time resulting in planned project delivery timescales. Long delay incurred on collection of controlled/ contaminated waste materials by specialist Japanese Knotweed sub-contractor.
"Poor planning in delivery and pick-up of long reach. Supply of additional long reach necessary to complete soil nailing works. Extremely poor organisation, planning of long reach delivery and pick-up by plant supplier, leading to extension in duration of road closure. Specialist sub-contractor expertise, knowledge and professionalism lead to reduced delay and down time on site."
No risk register. Onsite management. No risk register incorporated at tender stage. Weekly site progress meetings held.
"All works delivered to high standard. All works were undertaken and delivered to a high standard, to specification, leading to swift client handover and acceptance. H&S file submitted within the required timescales following completion."
"Implementation of standardized site set-up, trialed safety arch and LED lighting. Extremely confined site set-up. Standardised site set-up successful creating logical pedestrian flow and ease of navigation. Safety arch location key to creating standardised safety message and directive. LED raised JMS company profile. Site set-up and available parking/ segregation of pedestrians and vehicles extremely problematic and difficult to implement due to close confines of compound location."
"Japanese Knotweed hampering progress onsite. Controlled/ contaminated waste disposal inadequate. Use of plant nappies, drip trays and spill control onsite. Full assessment of the extents of Japanese Knotweed encroachment on site works was not undertaken prior to commencement of works. Mitigation measures reactive instead of proactive. Full assessment of the extents of Japanese Knotweed encroachment on site works was not undertaken prior to commencement of works. Mitigation measures reactive instead of proactive. Long delay incurred on collection of controlled/ contaminated waste materials by specialist Japanese Knotweed sub-contractor. Strictly controlled, implemented and regimented usage during all re-fuelling, use of plant and materials handling/ storage works."
"Approximately 1 week’s delay due to poor performance of drilling team due to poorly maintained/unreliable drill. A newer, better maintained drill would have been more reliable and not broken down as frequently."
"Site offices set up on existing hard standing out of site of the bridge, saving on security and utilising existing site conditions. Drilling carried out using excavator and drilling rig, saving temporary works costs and time associated with using scaffolding. All brickwork repairs at height carried out using a MEWP saving time and cost on scaffolding."
Design was schematic based and did not need F001- F003 process. Construction was carried out largely to design and changes were recorded as part of AFC issue.AFC production was not included in design price. This should be included in future design contracts.
Scaffold towers were only temporary works on site. These were erected by PASMA operatives.
"Weekly staff vehicles not transferred to next site following completion. Vehicle rates should be included in staff rates where applicable, Drilling head very unreliable and broke down often. A newer and better maintained drill would have been more effective. Excavator was unable to hold drilling machine at height for without use of props to maintain position at high level. The machine was old and unable to hold the weight so a newer and better maintained machine might have been more effective."
All materials ordered in advance of works.
Works were carried out on a now closed sidings line. Therefore the site foreman was also the COSS SW and savings were made in this way.
"Tender / Estimate Understanding of contract / client requirements Administration of contract Change control (including time bar) Communication (including document control, progress meetings) Final Account All carried out as per Quality plan and Murphy procedures."
Considerable time in getting cube test results from subcontractor.
"Post grit blast inspections included in contract programme. Long lead times. Demonstrating that the introduction of the pause in the programme for post grit blast inspections, accelerates the process of agreeing additional works, mitigating the likelihood of programme delay/ extension of programme. Long lead in time required on additional refurbishment materials identified post grit blast inspection, leading to remobilization costs to undertake additional works."
"Suitable compound area obtained, which facilitated clear demarcation between pedestrians, vehicle movements and sufficient storage areas for plant and materials. Compound area in close proximity to site working area. Prefabricated step units to access/ egress trackside installed behind schedule."
Post grit blast inspection additional repair details difficult to install. Long lead in time. Post grit blast inspection additional repair details difficult to install. More efficient and practical solutions to be proposed by the designer. Long lead in time required on additional refurbishment materials identified post grit blast inspection.
Scaffold and encapsulation design for GB&P works accurately and practically considered at design stage leading to effective control onsite.
"Works undertaken to a high standard due to training or competence of personnel. Resources required to undertake works were well planned, efficiently procured and delivered in good time. Met and exceeded project expectations."
Condition of delivered plant and equipment extremely good. All nearly new with correct and present certification.
Long lead in time required on additional refurbishment materials identified post grit blast inspection.
Late contract confirmation/ PO from NwR led to inefficient mobilisation and site set-up.
"Risk register incorporated at tender stage identified key project risks thereby enabling targeted and effective mitigation measures throughout the delivery of the project. Detailed site based KPI reporting evidence gathered and submitted weekly, fully populated and to an extremely high standard."
"All works were undertaken and delivered to a high standard, to specification, leading to swift client handover and acceptance. H&S file submitted within the required timescales following completion."
"Compound arrangement meant that all parties accessing/ egressing site being funneled into the signing in/ out, data-scope point, thereby reducing the likelihood of operatives not signing in/ out when accessing/ egressing site."
GB&P Works completed without incident due to effective installation and maintenance of encapsulation and decontamination mitigation measures. Air quality monitoring undertaken adjacent to GB&P encapsulation.
Terrafirma matting causing trip hazard. Need to level ground before setting out Terrafirma matting.
Issues with scaffold drawing not showing all structures clearly. Better scaffolding design required.
Issues with scaffold drawing not showing all structures clearly. Better pre start meetings on site with sub-contractors and Scaffolders.
Crossway scaffolders not on site until 10:00 on Friday the 11.09.15. Spoken to Crossways about the time operatives arrive on site.
Toilet steps do not fit the toilet block. Make new steps to fit individual toilets.
"Remaining contract works completed within additional works programme timescale, removing requirement for land access extension of time. Subcontractor management: Site management not experienced in GB&P works; insufficient reporting and achievable projected timescales, including materials lead in."
Daily passing of trains reduced daily productivity onsite Inaccurate design scope and preconstruction investigations. Isolation of OLE granted on a weekly basis resulting in time saving for this element of works. Daily passing of trains reduced daily productivity onsite. Circa 1.5 hours lost per day to passing trains resulting in programme slippage.
Post grit blast inspection additional repair details difficult to install. More efficient and practical solutions to be proposed by the designer. No separate working specification document.- Leading to confusion and inefficiency in orders.
"Scaffolding works execution, implementation and control onsite very poor and slow. Works not suitably resourced by subcontractor. Scaffold and encapsulation design for GB&P works accurately and practically considered at design stage leading to effective control onsite."
Works undertaken to a high standard due to training or competence of personnel. Subcontract works items poorly resourced and managed thereby incurring programme delays.
Condition of delivered plant and equipment extremely good. All nearly new with correct and present certification.
Long lead in time required on refurbishment materials and poor subcontract management lead to substantial programme delays.
Late contract confirmation/ PO from NwR led to inefficient mobilisation and site set-up.
"Risk register incorporated at tender stage identified key project risks thereby enabling targeted and effective mitigation measures throughout the delivery of the project. Detailed site based KPI reporting evidence gathered and submitted weekly, fully populated and to an extremely high standard."
"All works were undertaken and delivered to a high standard, to specification, leading to swift client handover and acceptance. H&S file submitted within the required timescales following completion."
Extremely confined site set-up. Site set-up and available parking/ segregation of pedestrians and vehicles extremely problematic and difficult to implement due to close confines of compound location.
"GB&P Works completed without incident due to effective installation and maintenance of encapsulation and decontamination mitigation measures. Due to close confines of compound location, adjacent green space within the compound area was utilised for lay down. Associated plant movements within this area caused ground to rut resulting in additional remedial works."
"Programme was well set up, in particular the hour by hour programme for the core possession remains a valued risk management tool for the site team. All Stats undertook their works in accordance with Programme Requirements."
"Although congested the site set up was well layed out and proved fit for purpose. Concrete inspection and testing was of a high standard, all concrete passed with no issues to report. The employment of out of house concrete testing remains a wise decision."
 It was noted during the construction that the designers (Opus) were very proactive in addressing Technical queries raised by JMS throughout the life of the project.
"Temporary works for crane access was delayed in being produced, potential scope for saving on material to procure if the temporary works design are  produced at an earlier stage. (Last minute ordering of retaining units). Access for crane resulted in structurally indeterminate boundary wall being demolished. Upon  demobilisation the extent of the structural defects became apparent so the wall could not be rebuilt (palisade installed in its place). It is suggested that a full survey of structures to be demolished should be carried out as part of temporary works assessment to ensure that reinstatement will be possible once the works are complete."
"At the midpoint of the project, due to increased work load within the business unit both the Foreman and Site Engineer were relocated to another site, while its appreciated that this must happen form time to time a suitable handover period should be allowed to ensure continuity and maintain HSQE standards."
"Internal Plant - Lift Cert was missing from RRV during core possession, Site team managed to contact relevant parties to ensure the cert was in order and was issues to site. Good communication within the business unit ensures such occurrences minimises down time."
"Requisitioning Incoming Inspection Stores Control Storage Stock Control Surplus / Wasted Materials Long lead items were procured well in advance, project was well set up form a project management perspective."
"All subcontractors performed well, all contracts were issued in a timely manner allowing efficient resourcing from the various subcontractors to give the project."
"Close proximity of existing pedestrian footbridge (which remained open for the duration of the works) led to some quite difficult working conditions for the site team. If a similar situation were to arise on a new project site team would suggest in order of preference 1. Erect temporary footbridge a suitable distance from the works. 2. If this is not possible insist/stress the point to NwR and local council the necessity to close the bridge during core works as a minimum, also some time should be allowed for in the programme for inefficiency due to erecting/re-erecting walkways to access a close proximity footbridge."
"Some local residents were concerned with work activities etc. before and during the works, JMS addressed and logged all queries, however NwR were at times quite slow in responding to the resident queries when they contacted NwR direct (helpline Number), this led to some frustration from residents promoting them to contact JMS site team more than they ordinarily would, resulting in a somewhat unnecessary distraction to site team. More involvement from NwR Project Manager would be beneficial going forward to ensure queries are followed up, JMS to raise awareness in progress meetings to highlight issues"
Waste department very helpful with skip exchanges.
"JMS utilised Volker blockade to deliver works outside rules of route possessions. Planned JMS works cancelled due to out-of-date NwR GZAC. JMS utilised Volker blockade delivery of main works, thereby reducing the works programme by approx. 6 weeks. NwR to ensure GZAC information is up-to-date and are in receipt of prior to JMS applying for line blocks, thereby avoiding abortive works costs."
"Round the clock blockade working reduced overall time onsite to deliver works. Inaccurate design scope and preconstruction investigations. Working areas well planned, implemented and controlled utilizing round the clock working leading to efficient and successful delivery of works. Coal tar underlying entire deck, not just localized to central girder section, leading to weep holes being unable to be drilled. Additional design input leading to confused and increased pressure delivery strategy onsite."
"Inaccurate design scope supplied to designer. Insufficient site investigation works scoped and undertaken leading to amended/ minimized remedial works delivery. Coal tar underlying entire deck, not just localized to central girder section leading to weep holes being unable to be drilled. Efficient and practical working solutions implemented by an experienced and competent site team. Proactive and effective pragmatic planning of working methods leading to simplified and efficient implementation and execution of works. Removal of coal tar ahead of main blockade, over drill of existing bolt sets to aid in removal and replacement works."
Thorough and rigorous temporary works design scope. Temporary works execution and control onsite very good. Suitably qualified personnel onsite. Scaffold and partial encapsulation design for both land based and water based pontoon works accurately and practically considered at design stage leading to efficient and effective implementation and control onsite.
"High level of competence of JMS & subcontract personnel. Works items well resourced. Works undertaken as planned, no delays incurred due to inadequate training or competence of personnel. Resources required to undertake works during blockade and follow up works were well planned and accurately calculated. Met and exceeded project expectations."
"Configuration of pontoon and work-site plant lead to canal and tow path remaining open. Plant supply. Configuration of pontoon and work-site plant lead to canal and tow path remaining open throughout the duration of the works thereby mitigating disruption to Canal & River Trust, local residents and members of the public. Effective use of plant enabled increased diversification when configuring worksite set-up and management. Condition of delivered plant extremely good. All nearly new with correct and present certification."
"Scoping of FRP materials did not consider lead in requirements. Late contract confirmation/ PO led to insufficient procurement duration to achieve full delivery of works items within the blockade programme. Long lead in required for FRP ballast boards was not considered within NwR contract award timescale. Follow up works required additional planning, resourcing and costs."
Late contract confirmation/ PO from NwR led to inefficient and delayed/ deferred mobilization and site set-up.
"Risk register incorporated at tender stage identified key project risks thereby enabling targeted and effective mitigation measures throughout the delivery of the project. Inaccurate design scope supplied to designer. Insufficient site investigation works scoped and undertaken leading to a reactive solution. Coal tar underlying entire deck, not just localised to central girder section leading to weep holes being unable to be drilled. Reactive design solution, reduced working timescales."
"All works were undertaken and delivered to a high standard, to specification, leading to swift client handover and acceptance. H&S file submitted within the required timescales following completion."
"Specialized pontoon subcontractor supplied all necessary equipment and personnel to manage all pontoon working. Dedicated personnel throughout the duration of the works ensured effective H&S measures were maintained and implemented, i.e., safety boat, life vests, edge protection, rescue line and life rings."
Minimised extents of de[1]vegetation works. Noise created by compressor. Extents of de-vegetation works locally agreed onsite by JMS/ NwR to minimise de-vegetation legacy impact to local residents adjacent to canal and bridge. Compressor was re-positioned to reduce nuisance to 3rd parties. Compressor used within day works only.
Land access agreements which are arranged by the client were late meaning the start on site was delayed and the programme duration condensed. The Nuclear Density testing for the installation of the stone infill was very time consuming as it had to be done at every 150mm layer. The core possession duration for installing and compacting the fill was a very long time due to the very slow and time consuming testing regime. Preconstruction and site team to liaise with the client and emphasise the importance of starting land access negotiations in good time to allow for start on site as per programme. Try to get approval from the designer/engineering team to use a method specification for the installation of the fill during the core weekend. The fill done in advance can be witnessed and tested to support this.
During the installation and compaction of the stone fill prior to and during the core possession every single nuclear density test passed with flying colours. Track monitoring for weeks after the completion showed no consolidation settlement. Commend site installation team for good quality works. Recommend that similar compaction method is used for future schemes delivered during CP5.
"A substantial haul road needed to be installed to access the works, a geotechnical soil mixing solution was chosen to promote innovation and sustainability. The haul road held up well to the demands of the works. Installation was successful and efficient. Promote the use of this system within other JMS delivery teams. The methodology for the installation of the fill during the possession was using multiple tracked machines with one machine being a 13tonne long reach. Site team recognised that although the works were successfully delivered, a 20tonne long reach would have made the works more efficient and quicker. Take the recommendations from the site delivery team and brief them to other teams on similar works.During the core possession JMS were ahead of programme and in a position to start the installation of the bottom ballast prior to the PWay contractor returning to site. The JMS engineer was not familiar with the line and levels for the PWay installation and an opportunity was lost to gain time. Suggest that for future works the PWay engineer is on site earlier than originally planned so that any setting out for PWay works can be accommodated when ahead of programme. PWay and Civils setting out engineers to work closely together and be familiar with the crossover elements of both packages."
Many of the subcontractor’s operatives who attended the prepossession Hub Day were NOT the personnel who worked during the possession. Insist that the supply chain subcontract operatives who attend the hub day are the same team programmed to work during the possession. Feed back to the subcontractor that their resources need to be planned more efficiently and consistently
Badgers were identified in the area not too far from the works and a proposal from JMS to install badger routes through the infill was not accepted by the client. Missed opportunity to cater for the wildlife in the area with the design of the infilling works. Try to develop this for future schemes with similar issues.
The subcontractors and other stakeholders attended a Hub Day immediately prior to critical works. It was agreed that this focused minds and helped keep people safe. The day was delivered by a safety coach who was one of the site operatives which reinforced its credibility. Prior to critical blockades or other key programme dates organise a mini hub day
Preconstruction team identified the approvals which would be required with the Environment Agency and 3rd party land owners and completed all necessary agreements in advance of the works. Continue to successfully identify advance long lead in agreements which will be necessary with 3rd parties and get them in place early on in the life of the project.
The scheme was delivered on programme all the way through its duration. Buying department helped with this by procuring the precast units at short notice. NWR pushed for the job to start in the winter but this scheme would have been better suited to been built in the summer. Involvement from the whole team in development of the programme led to buy in from all and this led to it been followed right the way through the job despite challenging weather at times. NWR and JMS need to agree long term programme so that schemes that need to be delivered in the summer are.
Engineering control and method of works deemed to be very good on this scheme. Standard of precast units from Moore Concrete were very high and inspections carried out by Fergal Coughlan would have helped here. A competent Engineer is to be used on all schemes. Early buy in from the whole team to agree the method of works to be carried out all schemes. Recommend using Moore Concrete for precast units and Fergal Coughlan for carrying out inspections going forward.
Dal were the designers for this scheme. First draft was not constructible. Re-design meant that we overspend by £14k on design work. The designers were not pro-active and generally unhelpful through the Grip 6-8 programme. The ignore concerns raised by the construction team. We would recommend not using Dal again.
The JMS temporary works team did a good job. The temporary works process was followed through correctly and all documentation kept up to date. Site visits by the temporary works teams will help with ensuring the design is adequate and the proper process is put in place and adhered to.
"The JMS site team, the sub-contractors and the suppliers all performed well. It was a well-established team supported well by management and engineering. Consistency promoted through site team, enabling better communication between JMS, the sub-contractors and the suppliers. QS visits once a week led to good communication between team and commercial team."
There was no issues with Plant and Transport on this scheme. Shovlin RRV + Op were good. Rates been charged for internal plant are higher than CP5 rate allowances. Site Manager met with P+T team weekly and this needs to be done on all schemes going forward. Schemes cannot deliver a profit using JMS plant.
All materials were delivered on time despite challenging lead in times due to design issues. Consumables of low value that needed to be bought at short notice from local retailers had to undergo the bureaucracy of larger purchases. This led to the team having to buy items themselves and claiming back. Good communication with the buying department was key to the positive outcome. We recommend that a purchase order be placed in the local hardware store for consumables with the Site Manager/Foreman keeping a logbook for what is purchased.
"Dal were the designers and the feedback is poor on their performance. On Track carried out the de[1]veg works and the feedback is that were good. On Site carried out the dam works and the feedback is that they were good. SLD Pumps provided all the pumps and set up the over pumping system. They performed very well. Aspull Engineering did the steel work and they were very good. We recommend not using them again. We recommend not using them again. We recommend using them again but have reservations about the system that they used for that job. However, this was due to the flow rates they were given to work off and these were highly variable in winter time. We recommend using them again. We highly recommend using them again."
The job was priced correctly and there was adequate commercial involvement throughout the scheme. The weekly visit from the QS ensured good communication between the construction and commercial team.
No QA’s raised on this scheme. H&S file was submitted in a timely manner but designer held this up also producing the as build drawings. Site Manager to complete H&S file before moving onto next job.
Site set-up on an existing area was very good. Signage could have been a better quality. Consideration should be given to having the site set[1]up a bit further away from the site if it’s a more suitable location. Consideration needs to be given to there we are working in and the time of year when choosing the type of signage we use.
There were no environmental issues on this site. EA consents was got in adequate time. Material was re-used on site to minimise waste. Early involvement with the environmental team led to no issues.
"The supply chain was involved in the development of the hour by hour programme. This ensured all parties bought into the programme • The programme should be challenged early by the project delivery team to confirm its integrity. • Compilation of the programme should include all the relevant people particularly the designer, supply and site teams. • Buy in and collaboration on the programme is essential. Regular updates, weekly, daily look ahead should be the norm."
"Control adjacent to structures was removed during demolition, impacting on P Way setting out leading to small delay in tamping works at Doxey. SAIP Interface changed late into the project causing additional works for JMS with improving and maintaining access road • Daily integration meetings held by SAIP in which plans kept changing and key dates changed which impacted on our production. • Environmental issues raised late within programme, meant methodology changed several times in order to overcome issues. Environmental issues should have been closed out sooner. • Methodology of robust kerb installation was slightly amended during the core possession sue to small stability issues. This was due to the position of the bearings. Bearings not placed during trial erection. In future bearings should be placed as part of trial erection. Despite several meetings with TXM, the lift plans developed could not be undertaken fully as driver was inexperienced. Despite minor amendments to robust kerb installation the methodology developed worked well and was delivered."
Surveys undertaken previously did not provide information to allow correct detailing of interface with existing structure
All permits to lift undertaken and worked well in difficult environment under overheads. Late change to methodology due to Environmental issues resulted in a need for a crash deck. Design also allowed for a walkway which removed need for fall restraint system.
Resource sheet produced detailing contacts etc. allowed site access to confirm attendance daily. Hotels booked for all operatives who lived further than 1hr away from site. Several managers involved in the site management leading up to the blockade. Ideally one manager per site covering all works including the possession would be the ideal.
Despite extensive planning and numerous meetings the TXM operative was not the experienced operative we had been assured would be provided.
Stobarts .JMS had to assist the Stobart P Way gang with resources to ensure programme was maintained. Meetings held prior to the core possession and resource sheet provided but still resources not sufficient.
"Welding .2 No welds have been identified as non- compliant at Doxey brook, Remedial works will be undertaken during week 45"
ORR Visit. Hazard spotting. Minor issues raised by ORR in relation to safety glasses being worn by 1 operative and P Way subcontractors loading of vehicle. Feedback cards raised by operatives throughout the possession with actions raised closed out.
SSSI Area .Works well managed within the SSSI area of Doxey.
General Teamwork was superb by everyone involved in the core possession delivering on time.
"Multi Funded project with 20+ stakeholders – There were changes within the team and knowledge that was lost through handover. Continuity could have potentially been lost. Where organizational changes occur more management is needed when so close to implementation needs to be understood better. Good early engagement with Rail Heritage. Management of 3 rd parties are more involved and good relationship have been maintained. Designs should be submitted with sufficient timing to NR which affected Programme and timings. Better consideration of the continuity of organizational changes. Better transition period and more engagement with the project team. Importance of engaging early and standardising the communication between 3rd parties. Design should be submitted first and then speak to the stakeholders to see the requirements for the project and then complete the programme after this has been submitted. Negotiation should be completed at design phase, and all stake holders should have visibility of this."
"NR were under resourced in a lot of areas. This is an issue internally. JMS had the competent and experienced people in the correct positions which worked well. TI were under re-sourced. Timeframe of obstructed where LBC time line was considered. Consideration of processes from external parties. Adherence to site rules and procedures – where subcontractors were not following site procedures this needed to be better managed on the next moving. Planning – possessions planned in that are known that they may not be met. Environment – Noise was not considered for the amount of noise generated by the grit blast and painting works. Safety – Housekeeping was a massive issue, paper suit being worn outside of the decontamination unit. Compound was constraint – plant was not stored adequately. Design. Careful consideration of subcontractor to be taken into account before using any subcontractor. Take into account requirements, process and procedures. Take into account of LBC timelines. Management on site should be more engaged. Planners should communicate more and agree possession times that are realistic including pricing. Environment – NR completed communications every 3 to 4 weeks with local residents, letter drops were completed. More consideration of where we can implement noise protection. Safety – Better relationships should be established more, throughout the site teams and use combined break out spaces and site offices. Testing of the ground conditions should be completed on schemes similar. Site compound should be take into consideration more. Site Team engagement should be completed earlier. To maintain the upkeep of the site a yard man should be used. Sequencing of design should be looked at for installation of Temporary works. Works were effected due to unforeseen changes to the temporary works."
"Programme –We aloud ourselves to bump certain works such as (Highway, TM) which were left to deal with later in the project programme, meaning the works were struggled to complete at a later date. This left potential for more issues later on in the programme. Commercial – Delays were picked up retrospectively after the events had finished, meaning it was based on memory and weak information. Changes only picked up when challenged by PM/Commercial. Instead of waiting for reports to come through from the contractor, JMS could have completed it to a point that would be accepted by the client. Delays should be logged as and when the event is occurring and recorded correctly and also reported in daily shift reports Improvement required in communicating change. Brief meeting to discuss how to report and what info required. More timely reports to come to NR as a pose of waiting for confirmation by the subcontractor, this is also assurance to the client."
Win-Win Relationships. Dependable Project Management – The project was successfully completed. We held weekly progress meetings with NR and WBC to ensure all issues were successfully. Integrity and Respect – Good community engagement with local residents and working collaboratively with NR and the council. Maintained strong relationships with stakeholders. Continued collaboratively working with the client. Ensure that future projects have regular meetings with all relevant stakeholders. Continue with good communication and engagement will all parties.
Clients should be included in all meetings throughout the project. Communication and operation of site teams and subcontractor was strained. All communication should be heard and listened to by the client and take into account of their past experiences of subcontractors. Establish better what is to be expected of the subcontractor and confirm understanding between all parties.
"Community engagement – This was done late, between NR, JMS and Local community. A walking route was not feasible, for the local residents and there was no alternative plan offered. Land Access – late engagement (No land access approved). Road Closures – Late approvals due to the local authority not fully on board with the plan. Unidentified Cables on Network rails Infrastructure. Issues identifying asset owners with NR or from outside suppliers and whether or not the cables were live or dead. Better relationship has now been established with the comms team to allow for early engagement. Liaise with the local elected members of the council. Busses were put on to transport local residents. Additional busses were provided from early morning to late evening. Early engagement is required on all future projects, with key milestones identified on the relevant programmes. Early engagement with land owners, and local planning at grip 3. Alternative plans should be considered during the planning stage. Earlier engagement required with all parties including residents. Identifying the correct maintainer disciplines and that all parties attend the site meeting. All cables to be tagged during the de-lap survey."
"AMP 010 walkout – PIC and relevant attendees from NR did not attend agreed site meetings, which delayed the identification of services on the infrastructure. Subcontractors – Story (Pway), Ainscough (Crane) & Osprey (SPMT). Methodology/ Design were altered to accommodate the late changes in sequencing due to late access availability. Two interfacing projects being undertaken by NR and neither one had knowledge of what the other was doing. A new signal had been installed at the end of the bridge, which had not been considered during the design stage, as the project team were not aware of the new installation. This was only picked up 12-14 weeks before site mobilisation. Site Security – Multiple trespassers during the construction phase. One break in and several incidents of vandalism. JMS procured the services of a security company in Manchester as directed by Head office. JMS and NR agreed to have 24hr security for the first 6 weeks and then 12hr security thereafter. High Quality of Build – Expertise and professionalism throughout the project lifecycle. Independent QA inspections carried out. QSRA & DWWP – QSRA failed initially, with some of the logic links adding to the failure. DWWP NR and JMS planned worked well to ensure two core possession requirements were agreed in weeks 4 and 9. Weekly conference calls – NR and JMS project teams held weekly conference calls to identify key issues and propose solutions. Members of the project teams were given actions to close out. Engineering – NR Project Engineer, JMS CRE and TGP designer worked collaboratively to resolve changes and design to ensure the desired outcome. Engineering - There was a quite a bit of tweaking with bog-mats, skids etc on-site both before & on the possession itself. JMS Engineer to produce cross section of road-levels under SMPT (wheel locations of SPMT to be set-out & surveyed on road) & these compared against the soffit levels of bridge as a double-check to ensure SPMT has enough scope to remove/install the bridge. Engineering - Tight tolerance to install bridge deck with SPMT due to scope of movement of SPMT. Ospery & Ainscough very helpful on-site. Job well planned out and good work by project team to re-design job in short space of time. Key milestone included to programme with adequate time aloud for attendees to confirm attendance. NR IP to engage with the PIC during the liaison planning. A full site survey should be completed by all subcontractors carrying out any Temporary works design. Any change in design should be considered in the installation methodology vice versa. NR IP to engage with the PIC during the liaison planning meeting. NR to ensure that project integration has been carried out prior to site mobilisation. Explore options to use local security companies. Early engagement with BTP and local police force to understand the security requirements. Visit local schools to inform of dangers around the proposed works. (Early community engagement). Continue expertise and professionalism throughout the project life cycle. QSRA should be reviewed between planners between NR and JMS prior to the QSRA meeting. Good practice for any schemes with similar issues. Good practice.On future jobs a meeting with Ospreys Project Engineer on site to discuss/confirm their design after it has been issued, to confirm levels etc. & make sure everyone is satisfied with the proposed height of SPMT. larger space to be provided between deck & plinths or plinth to be removed on one side so bridge deck can be driven straight in & doesn’t need to be dropped between the 2 plinths. Plinth can then be installed as separate Pre Cast Unit. Granted on this job the bridge was initially designed to be driven in fully with SPMT so wouldn’t have been an issue with original installation method. Design consideration on future projects, for minimum 75mm overhang. If Story are carrying out CRE and handback duties, it would be beneficial to supply all CRE contacts to Story in advance of works to allow communications to be held directly with individuals to discuss affected assets to avoid messages being lost in translation."
"Failure land access – NR unable to secure land access agreement as part of the site establishment which impacted on programme. Procurement – Target cost were originally agreed as part of the original design, however there were several commercial changes agreed as part of the new design installation and methodology. New project was a commercial success between NR and JMS. Trial Erection – took place however the dates were altered which meant NR could not confirm their attendance due to late notification. Testing and commission of signal – Lindbrokes installed and commissioned signal however there were difficulties during the testing and commissioning as Lindbrokes were unaware of the process to liaise with Manchester Rail Operating Centre (ROC) to hand back the signal. understand some key activities to ensure the handover between disciplines are clearly managed. Civils Programme was tight in handing over to track aspects, and subsequently that affected the signalling and OLE (Not helped by the poor welding performance). Maybe building contingency into the bridge install would help the shift patterns as Story are often asked to attend site earlier than planned even thought eh bridge is not quite ready to handover."
"Never harm - No accidents occurred on site throughout the project. Integrity and respect - Local engagement with the community members on several occasions, transportation arranged for the local residents due to a walk way not being feasible. Win Win relationships – Working closely with Network Rail, to change the methodology for installation of the bridge. One Murphy/Always Deliver – JMS and NR worked collaboratively throughout the project resulting in a successful build. Good practice to use on all future project relating to schemes of this nature. Best practice to involve the client throughout all stages of the project. Best practice to involve the client throughout all stages of the project."
"NR and JMS proactive engagement to resolve issues around unidentified cables on bridge. RAM – Happy with the Quality of the build with very little snagging requirements. Project (IP and JMS) – NR maintenance relationship was challenging. Good practice. Good practice. Joint walk out’s with IP, JMS and other contractors required to define assets and buy in from everyone."
Tunnel Signage requirements. Clear scope of signage requirements. JMS to close out installation of tunnel signage in Wk10 Sunday night line blockage. 2 x limited clearance signs to be installed (1 x either end of the tunnel) 5 x tab markers to be removed at high level utilising podium scaffolding. Location and details to be clearly annotated on the scheme drawings Renewal of section markets to be clarified and noted as “remove and install new tab markers”.
"LCI rail appointed as p-way subcontractor. Ropetech Access solutions appointed as the deveg removal and brickwork repairs subcontractor. Integration with NEWP Phase 5 – unplanned works carried out within the week 45 possession. Works not discussed or agreed at PICOP meeting or whiteboard meetings prior to works taking place. QRSA completed and ran smoothly passing first time, no requirements to amend the programme for the core works. QRSA meetings completed in a timely fashion. Additional time added within the programme to allow for unknown ground conditions when excavating. No public complaints, a letter drop was carried out ahead of the works. Damage to JMS vehicles during possession working. AMP process completed from the NR IP team within a timely fashion. Land clearance process not holding much weight in not enforceable (throughout the infrastructure). Insufficient up to date asset information provided by client. As built information to be provided at close of the project. Positive feedback from JMS and NR. EWN raised due to commercial implications as a direct result of the programme slippage due to reasons listed item 2.3. Network Rail raised the issue as a close call Look at alternative access solutions for possessions access / easements. Core possession handed back 3 hours ahead or planned programme activity. Clarification of time savings to be considered. Future programmes would be planned in a similar manner for future projects. Engage with local businesses to facilitate additional parking and possible use of a safe designated parking area and utilise a mini bus service. Network Rail to advise of hot spots and incident reports ahead of works commencing on other projects. Network Rail to follow up and chase all required parties for closeout and sign off. Network Rail to review with properties and review the process JMS to include on future risks and opportunities register. Network Rail IP to provide JMS with up to date asset information. JMS to include on future risks and opportunities register. Network Rail IP to ensure the required internal process are followed and the required information is provided to the relevant department."
"Success - Land Access was reviewed and negotiated well in advance to starting site, early comms with all stakeholders, with NR and JMS. Land access issues with NEWP Phase 5 – access points where not left clear of plant and materials. Land clearance certificate. Material tested on site to avoid any unrequired excavation. Independent engineer present on site during the works to confirm the extent of excavations. NR IP team to engage with Senior Project team. NR to engage with all departments (including PIC) and projects working within the vicinity of works. future similar projects. Inclusion of hold point within the programme for discussion within the QSRA, this will formalise the options and opportunities on the project."
"Never Harm – Unrealistic expectations of people due to work load. Innovation – TW for cable trough support. Site Managers well briefed, atmosphere on site calm and collective and all in control of works. Good segregation of works within the tunnel using physical barriers around working activities to demarcate the works taking place. Fit to Start – Land Access was early agreed early. Contractor and client side, apparent across all business functions. Share the TW solution with business sector. Leave capacity to enable trough lids to be removed in future implementation Changes to site conditions and TW need to be captured via the TQ process. Good practice and share with other projects utilising similar works. Good practice and share with other projects utilising similar works. Maintain."
"JMS proactive collaboration with NR to achieve site access requirements with NWEP. Smooth running of project/ Site management including commercial. Project (IP & JMS) NR maintenance relationship was good. Identification and prioritisation of brickwork repairs to be reviewed at an early stage and included within the design. Ensure all works are being carried out in accordance with the most up to date information. NR IP Team coordinated JMS access requirements with NEWP Phase 5. Well planned with resources allocated in a timely fashion prior to the start of Project. Joint walkouts earlier with IP, JMS, Other contractors etc. to define the buy in from them. JMS to advise Network Rail what repairs can be completed within the budget to enable IP to review works with the RAM. Network Rail IP to liaise with the RAM and parties internally to ensure smooth and effective running of the project."
"Site Team worked well, even during holiday season and other contributing factors. Arcaidis designer. When the existing buttress was identified, Arcaidis were attentive straight away. Good supplier relationship maintained."
Management of Cost. Programme. Early warnings to be agreed earlier with Network rail. Use the pre start walk out to agree prioritisation between activities concerning the brickwork. Project completed under programme.
"Digging of trenches. Scaffolding Design. AMP16 - No snags were identified in the final walk out with NR, which is a credit to the site team. Trenches should have been dug out earlier which would have allowed more time in the programme, which would have given a more comfortable timeframe. Pre-construction investigation in trenches could have been more thorough. The scaffolding should have been measured to be built from the highest point of the Copers on the bridge, which would allow room to adjust the scaffold tower. This should have happened before the scaffold got to site.Detail for fixing the copers required grout, if completed again mortar would be preferred, as this saves time and is less expensive. Solway to be used if done again."
"GAP Plant Hire. Roro Skip. Plant provided by GAP was in poor conditions, when reported it took several days to fix the plant provided. Proved very good and efficient for the tidiness of the site."
"1. Successfully delivering a medium size scheme. Contractor on site, Can Geotechnical, the programme was delayed slightly due to NR delay in TQ to brickwork repairs. Run over by 3 weeks, every other item finished on time. 2.Sequence of Programme not Adequate The sequencing of the works, worked well and sections were completed on time. Include risk duration in the programme for loss of time to account for TQ process. Site Managers interface in programme was successful despite delay from TQ as raised above. Accountability of durations and sequencing was maintained over durations and sequencing of specific tasks."
"Coffey where the designers for the scheme. The only real issue with their design was the fact that the design was based on assumed quantities of scaling. They need to provide firm quantities from the offset to reduce the risk of growth in cost and volume, which currently sits with JMS. Lessons Both designs for Kidderminster and Hagley were produced by Coffey in the same period. Therefore, similarities occurred in scope change on both. Moving forward general management of designers, and tying designers into clear and defined scopes of remediation. Get the designers to agree the works on site and stick to it. If there are genuine changes which occur to the works throughout the prices then these need to be captured correctly and not undertaken at risk."
"The scheme is currently forecast with 35k overall profit, however there is still 165k of unagreed change to discuss which may increase the overall return substantially. Great result financially which with some solid commercial close out could improve significantly."
"Contractors CAN worked well together, professional, clean and tidy. All of the site team worked well together, JMS and VA. Consistency promoted through site teams, enabling better communication between jms / Subbie, and commercial to site teams."
"The cabins on site at Hagley Cutting were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from London Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 15/06/2015 until 22/10/15. There were no incidents or accidents throughout this time. NR ORR visited site on a number of occasions and jms received good feedback from these visits. Continue in the same vein as we left off at Hagley, take into Watford the same mind-set and commitment. Teamwork and cultural development to be further enforced moving forward across future schemes in the CP5 Workbank."
"All landowners where very accommodating and helpful throughout the scheme, no issues. Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, remember they are still there when we have packed up and left!!!"
"Network Rail had issues with turnaround times of TQ process, which were the main contributing factor to the 3 week over run. This needs to be highlighted to NR and adapted for future schemes as currently we are potentially in limbo with loss of programme float. Commercial to tighten up variation and change control process to ensure extension of time and float is captured correctly."
The scheme was delivered on programme all the way through its duration. Buying department helped with this by procuring the precast units at short notice .Involvement from the whole team in development of the programme led to buy in from all and this led to it been followed right the way through the job despite challenging weather at times.
Site set up/welfare was shared with Orlando St bridge scheme. Engineering control and method of works deemed to be very good on this scheme. This showed an efficiency. A competent Engineer is to be used on all schemes. Early buy in from the whole team to agree the method of works to be carried out all schemes.
The designer was Capita. The designers were not pro-active and generally unhelpful through the Grip 6-8 programme. They ignored concerns raised by the construction team. We would recommend not using Capita again.
The JMS temporary works team did a good job. The temporary works process was followed through correctly and all documentation kept up to date .Site visits by the temporary works teams will help with ensuring the design is adequate and the proper process is put in place and adhered to.
"The JMS site team, the sub[1]contractors and the suppliers all performed well. It was a well-established team supported well by management and engineering. The Site Manager was allocated to the scheme a little too close to the commencement date. Consistency promoted through site team, enabling better communication between JMS, the sub[1]contractors and the suppliers. QS visits once a week led to good communication between team and commercial team. Was not given adequate time to get a full buy-in to the build element of the scheme."
There was no issues with Plant and Transport on this scheme. Shovlin RRV + Op were good. Site Manager met with P+T team weekly and this needs to be done on all schemes going forward.
All materials were delivered on time despite challenging lead in times due to late receipt of AFC. Good communication with the buying department was key to the positive outcome. As was regular confirmation emails and supplier details sent by Debbie Brierley.
Capita were the designers and the feedback is poor on their performance. Orion were used to supply Safety Critical Staff and Hand Back Engineer and feedback was good. We recommend not using them again. We recommend using them again.
The job was priced correctly and there was adequate commercial involvement throughout the scheme. The weekly discussion with the QS ensured good communication between the construction and commercial team.
No QA’s raised on this scheme. H&S file is 90% complete at this stage.
Site set-up was very good. Efficiencies were achieved by sharing the site compound with Orlando St scheme.Only 1 incident on site which was damage to a surface cable caused by debris falling from RRV spoil box The correct reporting process was followed and the incident was closed out.
There were no environmental issues on this site. Early involvement with the environmental team led to no issues.
The use of blockades had a very positive effect on programme. The outputs on one weekend may equate to up to one months in normal access .Utilise disruptive access where possible on all drainage schemes.
The use of two compounds worked very well allowing us to bring spoil to one and deliver materials from the other. The Engineers were inexperienced in P-Way and were overloaded having to carry out track monitoring as well as supporting the operatives. This showed an efficiency in productivity and we would recommend doing this in all drainage schemes greater than 1000m if feasible. Pway CRE to brief Site Engineers prior to any scheme with PWay interface. Track monitoring to be sub-contracted out on all but very small drainage schemes.
The designer was Capita. The designers were not pro-active and this delayed the price being agreed meaning the scheme had to be mobilised in a reduced timescale .We would recommend not using Capita again. The quality was poor and this put a lot of pressure on the start date of the scheme.
The JMS temporary works team did a good job. The temporary works process was followed through correctly and all documentation kept up to date .Site visits by the temporary works teams will help with ensuring the design is adequate and the proper process is put in place and adhered to.
Continuity of staff and operatives including RRV drivers was key to scheme being delivered on programme. The use of a whiteboard for briefings and to communicate between day and night shifts was very successful. Maintain the same team throughout the duration of drainage schemes where feasible. Whiteboards to be used on all schemes with a permanent site set up.
Loading shovel increased time getting RRV plant on & off track and loading the trailers. There was a big issue getting plant off hired at the end of the scheme due to a back log in the P&T dept. Utilise loading shovels on all drainage schemes with sufficient size compounds to accommodate them. Utilise loading shovels on all drainage schemes with sufficient size compounds to accommodate them.
All materials were delivered on time despite challenging lead in times due to late receipt of AFC. Good communication with the buying department was key to the positive outcome. As was regular confirmation emails and supplier details sent by Debbie Brierley.
Capita were the designers and the feedback is poor on their performance. Orion were used to supply Safety Critical Staff and Hand Back Engineer. We recommend not using them again. The sub-contract crane controllers were involved in both cable strikes and it is recommended that we use JMS crane controllers on schemes were cable strike is a significant risk.
The job was priced correctly and there was adequate commercial involvement throughout the scheme. The weekly discussion with the QS ensured good communication between the construction and commercial team.
Too much re-work was required at the end of the scheme .There needs to be better communication of the standard of work required before the scheme begins and this must be checked regularly as the scheme progresses.
"There scheme had two cable strikes. Toolbox talk required on the permit to dig procedure prior to the commencement of excavations. All services to be split ducted, the sleeper spray painted up and signage be put in the cess to ensure services cannot be missed."
The use of trains for material delivery and spoil removal meant that approx. 250no. lorry journeys were not required .Look at the feasibility of trains for material delivery and spoil removal on all on track drainage schemes.
"Contractor on site, Tree Fellers (De-veg only), the programme was met on time and on target. The sequencing of the works, and the duration of the activities reflected the actual time frame for the works. Vegetation was cleared ahead of programme. Piles installed ahead of programme. Removing spoil from site ballast shoulders where not protected from the plant movements and thus resulted in snagging of cross contamination. Site team had complete involvement in the planning of the scheme and programme. To enable them to have input and accountability over durations and sequencing of specific tasks."
"RJM were the designers, the design was delivered within the required timescales and AFC was issued in line with DRN. Lessons General management of designers, however on this occasion the design was delivered on time and within the expected programme duration."
Project Actualised with profit after substantial completion. Lessons Good programme. Well manage procurement process and forecast was implemented to give overall commercial success.
"Contractors Tree, fellers worked well together, professional, clean and tidy. All of the site team worked well together, JMS and VA. Consistency promoted through site teams, enabling better communication between jms / Subbie, and commercial to site teams."
"The cabins on site at the two schemes were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from London Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 25/11/14 until 18/01/15. There were no incidents or accidents throughout this time. NR ORR visited site on a number of occasions and jms received good feedback from these visits. Continue in the same vein as we left off at Garston / Muttchettts, take into Bridge Farm the same mind-set and commitment. Teamwork and cultural development to be further enforced moving forward across future schemes in the CP5 Workbank."
"All landowners where very accommodating and helpful throughout the scheme, no issues. Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, remember they are still there when we have packed up and left!!!"
"Network Rail had specific budget constraints on the scheme, and thus made it difficult from the offset to deliver. We however made two schemes operate from the same establishment and delivered efficiency on the budget and turned a difficult budget into a success. JMS to continue to look for efficiency in delivery of work for NR, and strive to make savings where possible.."
"Original Programme was 16 weeks – Actual duration of site works was circa 22 weeks – additional 3 weeks lost due to weather. Midweek nights implanted into programme of works. a) Planning stage was poor on the scheme, inadequate compound size sourced. b) Spoil removal from site difficult, 1st plan was to remove spoil by grab waggon on nights, however the compound was then subsequently amended to stockpile this in the location of the RRAP. c) Site Manager and Construction Manager need to have early involvement in the Tender process. d) Use of midweek nights towards the end of the programme to catch lost time at the front end, this came with a cost, which is not necessarily recoverable."
"Track Monitoring costs were far in excess of tender allowance. 2) RRV allowance in tender inadequate. A) Tender priced on Datum to complete track monitoring, using historic rates, these rates were incorrect and we expended circa 50k more overall. B) RRV Cost in tender was insufficient, tender error from estimator only having workable allowance for 1 RRV and associated trailers to construct the drainage."
"1) Depths for required drainage were far deeper than physically required due to local topography of the land. 2) Design approval timetable extended as this was the first scheme from this pot to commence. Change in pipe specification at the last minute lead to standing on site. A) Drainage drawings already signed off and not contested once works started, need to take lesson from this and address at design stage to deliver more feasible depths to reduce cost and working method costs. B) CRE change through the design delivery which had an impact on the timetable for approval. C) NR preferred option of solid pipe enforced on the scheme at the last minute which lead to delays 1) for the procurement of the pipe 2) re approval of the afc drawings. Pipe to lay was also more laborious (potential change to NR/Claim)."
"1) High turnover of resources on scheme. Insufficient resource allocated in tender. Due to works only being completed on a sat night, lads were resourced from all over to meet requirements. This lead to no consistency in delivery and output. 2) Only 1 main gang included within the agreed price, when actual level required was 12-15 men a shift. 3) 4 shifts lost on the scheme due to lack of skill set available to drive the Mec. Moving forward weekly resource meetings held to plan 3 weeks out of key dates."
"RRV allowance in tender not adequate. Operated plant supplier’s equipment had numerous breakdowns / leaks to hydraulics. 1) Loss leader from the start due to incorrect amount of rrv within the agreed price. Loss of circa 70k attributable to this area. 2) TRS supplied trailers had constant leaks, delaying the start on site, contra charge to be allocated to TRS to offset the loss."
Change in pipe specification / chamber specification. Already identified above.
"Sub-contractor requirement to be defined in pre adjudication to ensure that all costs are captured prior to the submittal of prices to NR. Sub-contract prices need to be based on project specific quotes and framework rates rather than historical data. B) Safety critical staff should be reviewed against the plant requirement for the project (E.g. 3 nr. RRVS will require 3 nr. Crane controllers) and the project execution plan. C) Use of Murphy Plant RRV’s if available. If not available, quotes to be obtained and reviewed to fine the most competitive rate. D) Murphy supplied S&T to the project on time. Cost has been captured as part of VO to NR."
Variations picked up late by commercial team. b) Change registers now being submitted on fortnightly basis. a) Variations have been picked up late by the commercial team. Better communication required between site and commercial team. b) Change registers are now being submitted on a fortnightly basis to ensure better communication between JMS & NR.
"Site Completed with minimal snagging, Despite overrun on both programme and commercial, works signed off by NR with praise."
"Flannerys delivery driver knocked over a BT pole. As earlier discussions with inadequate compound sizes, senior manager’s tour conducted by JMS concluded that the site looked poor. A) Delivery driver did not follow the designated delivery procedure and accessed site without the relevant banks man escort, consequently took out 2nr BT pole’s on exit of the compound. B) Compound was subsequently remodelled to give safer access/egress and improved material storage."
Hydraulic leaks to trailers Outfall consent A) Spill kits in use to prevent reportable incidents and managed well on site. JBA engaged with local authority at inception to ensure no outfall consent was required.
"Programme suffered a number of delays due to unchartered cables in the CESS. Variation in to recover lost time. However, works finished on site just 1 week behind expectation. The sequencing of the works, worked well until delays were suffered. This resulted in trying to maximise access throughout remaining 29 hr. oror, which meant that numerous activities were undertaken concurrently adding stress to the delivery. During the pre atc works, the worksite should have been swept with cat and genie, as a double check to ensure no nasties present. Site Managers interface in programme was successful despite delay. Potential float was used on delayed activities, were jms could have maximised output and demobilised quicker."
Overall design was well conceived and technical assistant was on hand throughout the delivery of the works to good effect. Would recommend future works with Byrne Looby. Lessons Promote success with award of future schemes to very competent designer.
"The scheme is currently forecast with overall 39kl loss, however there is still 80k of unagreed change to discuss which may increase the overall return substantially. Poor result financially which with some solid commercial close out could improve significantly and develop into a average return for the scheme. Frustration at site level due to initial delays, losing float, which seems unrecoverable."
"Resources have again suffered on this scheme at the start, with high turnover of lads due to other workloads across the business. Towards the end of the scheme, however this drastically improved and enabled a effe3ctive close out. Lesson Consistency promoted through site teams, enabling better communication between jms / Subbie, and commercial to site teams."
"The cabins on site at Meadowbank were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from Cannock Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 5/10/2015 until 08/04/16. There were a number of incidents, which were 2 requirements to call out the D&A team, with 1 positive reading. The other incident was to do with another contractor moving a tamper through our worksite without permission or notifying the COSS. Both are closed out internally and lessons learnt have been briefed to the teams involved. There were no reportable accidents throughout this time. Lessons Continue in the same vein as we left off at Meadowbank, take into Garston / bricketwood with the same mind-set and commitment. Teamwork and cultural development to be further enforced moving forward across future schemes in the CP5 Workbank."
"Due to a number of nearby residential houses, we suffered a large number of complaints about noise. These mainly came from 2 residencies. After a number of threats on site by the owner of the said residence, we had no option but to inform the British Transport Police. They worked with us in line with the granted section 61 notice to enforce our worksite and complete the works. JMS and NR PR were involved from the point of incident to manage the process in a more understanding and professional way, which seemed positive towards the end of the scheme. We are soon to return to the rear of the houses to increase the aesthetics of the slope directly behind the houses under instruction of NR and relevant change control. Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, members of the public. Remember they are still there when we have packed up and left. Better amalgamation of the PR department with delivery, ahead of future works, with the organisation of residents meetings to agree full extent of the works and working times upfront. Giving the locals a single point of contact to address concerns with."
"Network Rail worked with us on this scheme, especially when the residents started to revolt. Overall, it was managed effectively. To a successful completion. They are however slow to respond to closing out the outstanding change pots on the scheme and this needs to improve to enable us to recover what is rightfully ours. Timeline to be agreed with NR for closing out historic change prior to leaving site. To give accurate cost information throughout the process of delivery."
"Contractor on site, Vertical Access, the programme was on target until the loss of three shifts for the spray works due to the cold weather. Works identified for extras work stood for 4 weeks waiting for the order confirmation from NWR. The sequencing of the works, and the duration of the activities did not reflect the actual time frame for the works. Activities not made individual so could not close out some activities until further works had been completed. Include risk duration in the programme for loss of time to account for weather over winter periods. Site Managers to be engaged in the planning of the scheme and programme. To enable them to have input and accountability over durations and sequencing of specific tasks."
"Coffey the designers came out to site around four times and generally expanded the works, each visit finding additional areas of work. Which in turn added work to the overall programme. Even when the extra works where instructed, Coffey visited site during the construction of these and requested additional root balls and vegetation to be removed on top of previous instructions. Lessons General management of designers, and tying designers into clear and defined scopes of remediation. Get the designers to agree the works on site and stick to it. If there are genuine changes which occur to the works throughout the prices then these need to be captured correctly and not undertaken at risk. ."
"Project is forecasted to lose Money In the PEP meeting it was advised to site staff that an approximate allowance of 10K per week was remaining in the delivery allowance. The site prelims actually ran at 15k/week due to increased CP5 hire rates. Lessons Full adjudication to be undertaken for every scheme. Full and accurate forecast to be completed for each and every job, to better highlight the defined areas of overspend/profit. Plant to be managed better to avoid anomalies. Weekly submission of allocation sheets, fortnightly commercial reviews between delivery and commercial."
"Team worked together well Contractors Vertical Access worked well together, professional, clean and tidy. All of the site team worked well together, JMS and VA. Lesson Consistency promoted through site teams, enabling better communication between jms / Subbie, and commercial to site teams."
"The cabins on site at Kidderminster Cutting were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from London Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 18/11/14 until 22/05/15. There were no incidents or accidents throughout this time. NR ORR visited site Lessons Continue in the same vein as we left off at Kidderminster, take into Hagley the same mind-set and commitment. Teamwork and cultural development to be further enforced moving forward across future schemes in the CP5 Workbank."
"Building Good Relationships with 3rd Parties All landowners where very accommodating and helpful throughout the scheme, no issues. Lesson Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, remember they are still there when we have packed up and left!!!"
"Network Rail had specific budget constraints on the scheme, and thus made it difficult from the offset to deliver. When additional works arose we had to go back through the authority cycle to generate additional funding which in turn added to the overall loss on the scheme, through wasted time and production. JMS to stand firm on change and authority and not adapt / amend methodology or programme to suit the clients position unless achievable."
"Contractor on site, Can Geotechnical, the programme was delayed slightly due to NR delay in TQ to brickwork repairs. Run over by 3 weeks, every other item finished on time. The sequencing of the works, worked well and sections were completed on time. Include risk duration in the programme for loss of time to account for TQ process. Site Managers interface in programme was successful despite delay from TQ as raised above. Accountability of durations and sequencing was maintained over durations and sequencing of specific tasks."
"Coffey where the designers for the scheme. The only real issue with their design was the fact that the design was based on assumed quantities of scaling. They need to provide firm quantities from the offset to reduce the risk of growth in cost and volume, which currently sits with JMS. Lessons Both designs for Stourbridge and Hagley were produced by Coffey in the same period. Therefore, similarities occurred in scope change on both. Moving forward general management of designers, and tying designers into clear and defined scopes of remediation. Get the designers to agree the works on site and stick to it. If there are genuine changes, which occur to the works throughout the prices, then these need to be captured correctly and not undertaken at risk."
"The scheme is currently forecast with 23k overall loss, however there is still 80k of unagreed change to discuss which may increase the overall return substantially. Poor result financially which with some solid commercial close out could improve significantly and develop into a average return for the scheme."
"Team worked together well Contractors CAN worked well together, professional, clean and tidy. All of the site team worked well together, JMS and VA. Lesson Consistency promoted through site teams, enabling better communication between jms / Subbie, and commercial to site teams."
"The cabins on site at Hagley Cutting were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from London Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 15/06/2015 until 22/10/15. There were no incidents or accidents throughout this time. NR ORR visited site on a number of occasions and jms received good feedback from these visits. Lessons Continue in the same vein as we left off at Stourbridge, take into Watford the same mind-set and commitment. Teamwork and cultural development to be further enforced moving forward across future schemes in the CP5 Workbank."
"All landowners where very accommodating and helpful throughout the scheme, no issues. Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, remember they are still there when we have packed up and left!!!"
"Network Rail had issues with turnaround times of TQ process, which were the main contributing factor to the 3 week over run. This needs to be highlighted to NR and adapted for future schemes as currently we are potentially in limbo with loss of programme float. Commercial to tighten up variation and change control process to ensure extension of time and float is captured correctly."
"Contractor on site, Can Geotechnical, the programme was delayed slightly due to NR delay in Land access to flo gas compound. The sequencing of the works, worked well and sections were completed on time. However more detail would be of use with weekly milestones. Recovered in change control, closed out. Site Managers interface in programme was successful despite delay from access. Action on site management to develop the detail in the clause 14 to ensure weekly milestones are more effective and reviewable."
"RJM design for the scheme. Drawing details seemed standard, with little specific detail where required. Lessons Ensure moving forward that designers produce further details and minimise caveats where possible."
"The scheme is currently forecast with 40k overall profit, however there is still 50k of unagreed change to discuss which may increase the overall return substantially. Great result financially which with some solid commercial close out could improve significantly."

"The cabins on site at Mile Lane Cutting were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from Dav LAV Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 15/06/2015 until 22/10/15. There was 1 incident on site were a rrv clamshell pull out the cables on a axel counter, this was however fixed on the shift and no further action required. Lessons Continue in the same vein as we left off at Mile Lane, take into Watford the same mind-set and commitment.

"Building Good Relationships with 3rd Parties All landowners where very accommodating and helpful throughout the scheme, no issues. Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, remember they are still there when we have packed up and left!!!"
Network Rail performed well on this scheme however could have chosen better times to conduct audits on site. Saturday nights are not the best window of time. JMS To ensure all possession shifts have adequate management to ensure we are always ready and competent to act as required.
"Contamination from 3rd party land turned the programme on its head, to avoid unproduction work was reprogrammed to commence at the opposite. Issue was dealt with and 3 week extension was granted to complete the works .All in all finished 3 days earlier than anticipated. The sequencing of the works, worked well until delays were suffered. However quick reprogramming and action resulted in no unproduction and men were put to work in other areas as a result. Great management at site level of unknown issues. Good delivery of scheme ahead of programme. Successful scheme. Site Managers interface in programme was successful despite delay. Potential float was maintained and as a result demobilised quicker."
"JBA were the designer for this scheme. There were a number of issues: 1) New headwall detail didn’t work with the required levels of the embankment. 2) Precast cover slab detail was insufficient, measurements were incorrect. Better verification at approval stage by CRE would be beneficial. I think as the scheme was a small scheme this may have been overlooked."
"The scheme is currently forecast with return of 79k over anticipated profit, resulting in share pre uplifts of 32k gain. Good job. Solid result financially, which with some solid commercial close out will generate a good profit."
"Resource management on this scheme was top draw, same team started as finished. Good consistency. Lesson When Consistency is reached, results are evident. Move forward in the same vein to Sudbury Drainage."
"The cabins on site at Fenny were of an excellent standard. The cabins were delivered from London. Health and safety throughout the project was of a very high standard. The project commenced on 25/1/2015 until 06/05/16. There were no accidents or incidents during the delivery of the works. Lessons Continue in the same vein as we left off at Fenny, take into Sudbury with the same mind-set and commitment. Teamwork and cultural development to be further enforced moving forward across future schemes in the CP5 Workbank."
"Two landowners were dealt with to occupy land and deliver the scheme. Both were managed in a professional way and both were entirely satisfied with the works to the reinstatement at the conclusion of the job. Continue to be professional and courteous towards landowners, members of the public. Remember they are still there when we have packed up and left."
"Network Rail worked with us on this scheme. Overall, it was managed effectively. To a successful completion. They are however slow to respond to closing out the outstanding change pots on the scheme and this needs to improve to enable us to recover what is rightfully ours. Timeline to be agreed with NR for closing out historic change prior to leaving site. To give accurate cost information throughout the process of delivery."
"Site manager allocation was late which put pressure on mobilisation (this was an effect of late contract award as wasn’t sure if project would be delivered). Opportunities – programme opportunity to complete all works within the 29 hour blockade rather than utilising follow up RoR. Client relationship – worked well together to push through scheme in tight timescales, everyone played their part in getting us to site. Possession planning was undertaken 52 weeks out guaranteeing the required access, IP are supposed to assist with identifying section 7 opportunities for delivery but were not involved in this case. Planning – due to late changes to the delivery plan, possession cancellations were done out of time scales resulting in a high number of CRF’s being generated. Land Access not being granted reducing the scope of the scheme. Good Practice for JMS planners to take proactive approach to possession planning, not being reliant on IP. N/A to this scheme – General comment, on new remits JMS are to where possible design out the requirement for land purchase or temporary land take. Request a super user within the earthworks team (Stacey) so that the teams have local point of contact to make any changes."
"Late scope changes and rescoping of project from NR required pricing, which meant late contract award, which in turn put pressure on the mobilization. Qs allocated to scheme was on leave for the critical start up period of the scheme, it was found difficult to change the allocation of the scheme in 365, which affected commercial performance at the beginning of the project. Forecast accuracy on the scheme was good. No change on the scheme, original estimate covered all the risks & due to good management in delivery these opportunities were actualized. No change on the scheme, original estimate covered all the risks & due to good management in delivery these opportunities were actualized."
"The design had been previously been completed by others as It was discovered that no trial holes had been completed ahead of design, so any clashes for drainage was not identified. (NOTE: site team undertook trial holes ahead of main blockade and located a cable which if not found & protected prior to blockade would have slowed works down). When Polestar information was uploaded the NR team took 3 weeks to respond. Updating of NR records (polestar) JMS only have a few people trained to undertake this duty, which inputs time delays on completing the task. When validating design upfront surveys are not priced into the validation remit due to client budgeting, this imports a risk of design issues being found at setting out stage, are short duration project such as woodend this resulted in in TQ’s needing closed out with client within 10 days. DM to ensure allowance for construction level surveys. All PRE ATC schemes are to undertake trail holes, Design Managers are to ensure that trial holes are included at the design spec stage. There needs to be some control/responsibility put on NR in regards to timescales for closing out/agreeing records have been sufficiently updated. Train up so more people within EW to undertake this task, S.Witts to action. JMS to price in site walkouts for construction team to undertake mini buildability reviews as part of the validation of the design ( cannot assume that previous design team has got it correct)."
"There was an issue with procurement of drainage chambers, there was a mix up between procurement and supply chain. Materials arrived the Friday before Sunday blockade 4.1. SHES representative changed, however project management team were not informed, this resulted in paperwork approvals on acconex were delayed missing programme dates & importing pressure on mobilization. Murphy Plant – RR mech which is utilised for excavating drainage was sent directly from project to project without required maintenance being undertaken. The machines alternator failed resulting in the back up machine being brought in from supply chain, this caused 5 hour delay. Procurement meeting during lead in to scheme should involve site team & extend to material buyers. Discuss having single point of contact to manage material and subby procurement J.R. SHES to communicate changes to staffing and update on Aconex so not to hold up paperwork approvals. SHESQ has been divided into business unit, so Point of contact for EW&D is Tom Platt. There was a known seperate issue with the piece of plant however it was still allowed to go to site, process must be adhered to. Business case to buy another mech?"
"The correct team allocated to the scheme. Programme to enable successful delivery, programme in risks which means that if scheme is implemented well there is opportunity available. Due to having to move the access point 2miles further away from the site a Gator was utilised to transport operatives, this works really well. General Note: If rail brush is priced into schemes this will reduce snagging on drainage schemes. Overall portfolio management to ensure right men are available for the scheme. Business case to buy one, because if hired in we have to hire machine in too which prices the option out."
"Re-opening of carriageway completed 4 weeks ahead of programme, however this could have been up to 6 weeks earlier if additional surfacing works had not been undertaken by Bolton Council. Good Programme/Management of Statutory Authorities. Partnership with Local Authority. Close liaison between JMS and local authority to leave the temporary road closure in-place to enable them to undertake extensive resurfacing works along Grimeford Lane, outside the limits of our project. All Stats undertook their works in accordance with Target Programme Requirements. Close Liaison with Bolton Council resulted in them undertaking the surfacing works to carriageway and footway plus associated road markings free of charge."
"Large compound area obtained, which facilitated good demarcation between pedestrians, vehicle movements and sufficient storage areas for plant and materials."
Precast concrete items and other long lead items supplied by the client. Design was already at AFC when JMS were awarded the contract. No design details for proposed foundations to receive precast approach units. Service drawings insufficient information detailed.
NwR require the Lift Plan to be issued with the associated WPP when initially submitted for their approval. Going forward no WPP’s will be approved without the associated Lift Plan attached.
JMS Site Team. Vastly experienced with regards to the demolition and reconstruction of the structure and road lift associated with the Electrification of the Bridges.
Long Lead in Materials Procured early stage. Long lead items procured originally by Carillion and supplied to JMS.
"Waterseal, Corecut, Vertical Access & Ainscough vastly experienced with regards JMS requirements and methodology. Local Land owner employed to reinstate his own field (temporary compound), Gregory & Dickinson Limited."
QOB 001. QOB 002. QOB Nr 2 raised during the construction of the project. Insufficient cover to rebar cast within Client Supplied precast parapet units on north east and south west ends. Client supplied precast concrete units & Copers – Incorrect alignment of cast in sockets and dowel bars resulting in delay and disruption to the installation of the copers. Numerous dowels were cut off and new dowels drilled and resin fixed to ensure required profile was achieved.
When placing sub-contract orders we need to request they supply a waste management plan and all necessary certification necessary to comply with the regulations.
Good relationship with neighbors. Good relationship with local residents resulting in a letter of commendation from Anette Coward.
Re-opening of carriageway completed 3 weeks ahead of programme. Good Programme/Management of Statutory Authorities. Close liaison between JMS and local authority for Tameside MBC to use our road closure to carry out resurfacing works along the length of Mossley Road. We agreed a price with them to complete the surface course over the bridge thus reducing the number of joints in the surfacing. All Stats undertook their works in accordance with Target Programme Requirements.
"Good sized compound area obtained, which already had a water & electric supply. These avoided noise & fumes nuisance from the need for a Generator and the need for water tanks."
"Precast concrete items and other long lead items supplied by the client. Design was already at AFC when JMS were awarded the contract. The drawings were vague regarding the details for the proposed foundations to receive the precast H4a approach units. This added timescale pressures between the demolition & reconstruction Possessions to cast insitu concrete in time to place the precast units. It would be prudent to consider precast units that could be installed as part of the rebuild on future Schemes. The design had a requirement to installed permanent formwork to the ends of the Portals. These were to be fixed using bolts fitted into cast in sockets. This works in theory. However, they do not work in practice as the units would have to be positioned to the mm to fix the formwork. It would be more prudent to cast in sockets to receive dwyi bars for supporting Soldiers and temporary formwork. The number of dowels that had to be installed in the Cills was excessive. In order to prevent delays during the installation Possession, the cores for the dowels were drilled in advance. These had to be drilled to a larger diameter to allow for installation tolerances."
Original Design of Temporary Pedestrian/Service Bridge A number of Services had been supported on a temporary Service structure situated on the existing bridge which was totally unsuitable and would have prevented the demolition & reconstruction of the bridge. These should have been diverted onto a temporary bridge by the previous contractor.
JMS Site Team. Vastly experienced with regards to the demolition and reconstruction of the structure and road lift associated with the Electrification of the Bridges.
OTP was delivered in advance of the Possessions and performed well.
"Long Lead in Materials Procured early stage. Some materials had been procured by previous Contractor however, requests for documentation to prove that they were in accordance with the Contract Drawings & Specification were not provided. Some materials were therefore scrapped & re-ordered."
"Existing Supply Chain. Employment of Local Business. Waterseal, Corecut, & Ainscough vastly experienced with regards JMS requirements and methodology. Previous Contractor had upset a number of people who were adjacent the works. This caused increased costs for Craneage etc. when installing the new bridge."
Client supplied precast concrete units & Copers – Incorrect alignment of cast in sockets and dowel bars resulting in delay and disruption to the installation of the copers. Numerous dowels were cut off and new dowels drilled and resin fixed to ensure required profile was achieved. The H4a bridge parapet units had to be plumbed and packed and additional works carried out to some of the approach units. Bankseats installed by the previous contractor required remedial works to them.
"As stated above, mains electric & water prevented complaints from adjacent residential properties."
When placing sub-contract orders we need to request they supply a waste management plan and all necessary certification necessary to comply with the regulations.
Good relationship with neighbours Good relationship with local residents overcame the bad feeling that was present when we took over the works from the previous contractor.
"Due to contractual issues works commenced 3 months behind schedule. By receiving several sites at one time this has allowed us to programme fabrication and testing so as to reduce the visits of testers to site, reduce the time I have to hire welders."
Office set up is in Grangetown Cardiff and with the jobs being spread out all across South Wales a substantial amount of travelling is required. Surveying and setting out is very minimal Mechanical works are constructed off site and in blocks where possible to reduce the manufacturing costs. Inspection on site is carried out by the clients SPIs which can result in delays to the programme. Testing is carried out in block sites where possible to reduce the cost to the contract. Works are planned around this to make an expensive activity cost effective.
All designs are carried out by the client.
Temporary works have been developed for shuttering etc so as to suit all sites reducing the time delays on site.
Initial set up with Labour was new to the Gas AGI industry so training etc was expensive to get the site up and running. Following the initial training period Labour and staff began to adapt very quickly to a very demanding contract and through hard work and determination began to carry out the works in a very sufficient and cost effective manner. If to commence the works over again I would have Murphy engineers as the SCOs on all site as it gives them a good understanding of site management and as these are Murphy men they have a keen interest in the cost effective measures of managing a site. I did introduce this into one of my crews and as a result the programmes became shorter and quality of work increased.
Hiring and Off-hiring of external plant is a very smooth process. Personnel taking orders in the office have a good understanding of the plant and equipment required which always makes things easy. Maintenance and servicing of in house plant needs addressing. This contract has no regional office within close proximity and to have a fitter down for a break down is an expensive operation and cannot always happen swiftly resulting in additional costs of external hire to the contract.
Due the nature of this contract lead times on materials are a very important part in meeting deadlines on site. All materials are ordered once material take offs are received from the client so as manufacturing and installation is not delayed. Materials are ordered so as that we run at a minimum wasted material percentage as possible. Where possible we move the surplus materials to our next site. Where possible we buy in bulk so to reduce transportation and gain in reduced rates. Inspection and Quality control of materials is currently being carried out by myself. On such a large mechanical contract again I would have a quality person to assist on a part time basis as this can be very time consuming and pushed to the side from time to time.
The majority of the sub contractors have been set up by the site QS department from the offset with assistance from the subcontract department in Golborne. Many of the works are similar from site to site so from a subcontract aspect we utilise the same from site to site. This has a major advantage as we would have a great understanding of how each other works resulting in reducing time on site.
We have had 2 number internal audits over the duration of the contract and have received only very minor comments. Handover is carried out to the clients requirements and works are monitored and managed well by the sites document controller. Due to the amount of sites on this contract things got off to a slow start but we have put a dedicated records document control to look after this activity.
 As we have a large volume of sites we developed the paperwork around generic operation procedures and traffic management plan. We then developed one covering operation procedure that then lists out the relevant generic procedures required to carry out the works on each in particular site. Within this procedure we have included the hospital directions and traffic management plan. This allows the time to mange H&S from on the ground as opposed to having the H&S advisor in office developing reams of paperwork. It also allows the foreman to read one new document on each site as opposed to us issuing in the region of 20 operation procedures on every site. We have developed and improved this throughout the course of the works.
We are currently utilising a company through Golborne called Countrywide Waste for the waste management and we are returning a very high percentage as reused. This is being reflected in the project KPIs that are upgraded each month. To date for the 3years we have been on site we have had no major environmental incidents.

"Site / Office set-up (including security) Surveying Setting out Construction method. Inspections Testing. Site office and compound set up was exceptional, a good lay down area was provided by the client and the Principle Contractor utilised the space very well, ensuring the a control system could be easily applied and managed throughout the duration of the project. Security was also a success as a result of the office/compound set up and facilities, which in turn allowed a large quantity of materials and plant to be ordered at pre construction stage and easily secured. Surveying was difficult, as the client hadn’t provided all the required design and setting out schedules for the west coast mainlines, resulting in delays to work, loss of production and incorrect installation of copers, which had to be removed and replaced to the correct co-ordinates. The constant change of engineers throughout the project lead to miscommunication and the setting out side of things suffered as a result of this. The construction method was changed from the original programmed works and this resulted in conflict with the programme and confusion at site level (which in turn lead to loss of production and a disgruntled workforce) This leads to lack of direction and puts pressure on senior members of the delivery team which reflects on the physical workforce and the company brand/ethos. The decision to change the methodology and/or construction process can also be seen as a big positive, as this demonstrates that the principle[le contractor has identified issues at an early stage and rectified them with actions, this is a balancing act as some actions can bring good results, some can bring bad results, but the approach to the works was always that of a positive nature, with the clients, contractors, end users best interest in mind Internal inspections were good, from the delivery team, however there are requirements for senior members of staff to visit site and carry out inspections, this very seldom happened. Inspections of materials/plant/equipment was a downfall, this did not happen properly (as per the standards and procedures set out y the principle contractor) I believe this was due to the lack of knowledge and a shortfall from training/compliance. I also believe that cost constraints and workload leave very little room to manage all things great and small (effectively micro managing) which results in quality failings. No testing was required."
"Purchasing Lead times Design Change Design Review Drawing Control Management of subcontract designers (including communication) Management of internal designers .The design wasn’t completed in good time. There were lots of issues with setting out details for platform copers causing loss of time/manpower/materials etc….The proposals to use block paving on Platforms of this size during winter months wasn’t properly thought out in line with ‘possession’ of platform space during operational hours. This resulted in block paving works having to be developed on site as a working progress ensuring that the designers, client, and TOC were updated daily/weekly on progress (this was also a positive, another example of the flexible of the site team to adapt to the needs of the contract). Internal designs for temporary works were managed very well by an efficient team. Lead in time for materials as per design was easily managed as 90% of the materials were stock items. All design review/control/change was well managed with good monthly progress meetings and constant dialogue with the PC & client."
" Labour travelling from all over the country to work causing issues with working hours, overtime, travel time, fatigue……would recommend local sourced labour. Due to the other emergency works taking place during the length of this project, there was lots of chopping and changing of labour, this affected the consistency, fluidity, and progress of works and caused tension at site level. The core staff also changed several times during the length of the project resulting in issues. It was found that the cost driven changes resulted in more costs in the long run as the timescales and production levels were affected."
"Plant is always a bonus as Murphy’s have an internal plant department that caters for all types of rail equipment. The requesting and supply/demand side of things often caused problems considering the source of supply is less than 10 miles from site and plant was often borrowed from site for other works and returned with parts missing, service requirements etc and charges were placed against this project."
 Due to the large compound facilities it was easy to bulk order and stock materials at the early stages of the project. Stores are local which is a plus when collecting miscellaneous items on a daily basis. Materials were used effectively and recycled where possible.
The sub-contractors were managed on site and daily records were produced and stored. All competencies were available as and when requested.
"Quality control was good on site. 2 NCR’s were received for waste management, this was when the NCR process was being pushed and site representatives were a little unsure of the new process’s, I would consider this a bonus as the site staff were soon brought up to speed and waste management improved, along with various other parts of QA Control at site level."
" Site setup and welfare/mess facilities were first class, the site team has the best facilities I’ve ever seen on a Murphy job with lots of space for meetings, parking and storage. The site team often received praise from visitors on the standard of the facilities, supplied and owned by Murphy’s. Traffic management was good with lots of signs, designated bays fro materials, plant, equipment and parking."
" NCR’s for waste management as highlighted above. Separate skips, bunded storage areas, COSHH units and good waste management throughout the duration of the project."
"Relationship with TOC and station users .A great working relationship was formed with the TOC that benefits future joint ventures. The local station users got to know the site team and we built and maintained great rapour, issues highlighted were dealt with immediately and we received lots of good feedback throughout."
"Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. e.g. Production of Management of programme. Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence."
"Construction method - Innovative method of carrying out the works was proposed. Instead of erecting and encapsulating scaffolding around the bridge and having to work in winter months with rain and low temperatures with large risk of over run, JMS method is to dismantle the bridge and transport it off site to be worked on under factory conditions. Setting out - Accurate and sensible off setting and recording of the existing bridge’s setting out points resulted fast and efficient re[1]assembling of the structure with no discrepancies. Inspections and testing - JMS own COW Vicky Bailey had recently joined the company and carried out both on site and off site inspections of steelwork repairs and the application of protective treatments. The client was very happy and assured by the level of inspections and the experience of the personnel carrying out the inspections. Vicky also gave a lot of assistance and advice to the inexperienced JMS site supervisor on the quality checks and inspections required for this type of works. A change in the methodology for the works demonstrates JMS commitment to innovation. Suggest that this method is communicated to other JMS site teams and regions citing this project as an example of the method being carried out successfully, to timescales and budget and with the benefit of being able to deliver a better quality end product for the client. Setting out carried by the engineer checked by the PM and the stations established to record the location of the bridge were robustly installed and checked. Advice given by the PM to the engineer on the location of stations which were unlikely to be damaged / disturbed by the remainder of the works. Continue to support site supervisors on areas of inexperience."
Client carried out the Design - No major issues all required clarifications controlled via the TQ process.
Temp Works Design carried out in house by JMS to assess the reactions in the various bridge elements to be lifted – under estimated the complexity of the temporary works design which took longer than planned resulting in a delay on site. Additional checks required by an external design consultant. Temp Works Design carried out in house by JMS to assess the reaction of the various bridge elements to be lifted. Temp Works – permit to load and lifting operations. Temp works – Support and Transportation of the bridge units off site – good control from the site team and the supply chain results in the bridge being dismantled and delivered un damaged. Temp Works – scaffold encapsulation to the site elements – works designed and installed to a good standard which made the carrying out of the grit blasting works efficient. all required clarifications controlled via the TQ process. PM and CRE to review the complexity of the temporary works designs required when allocating the temp works coordinator and supervisor to ensure staff are sufficiently experienced for this type of works. Valuable experience gained by the JMS temp works design team. Temp works team is now in a better position to carry out designs for similar works. Procedure followed rigorously and subsequent inspections by the client on the shift when the lifting works is taking place results in the client having confidence in the site team’s procedures and the site implementation of such procedures. The temp works design was expanded to also cover the loading of the bridge onto the delivery vehicles and the methods of propping whilst on the vehicles. The site team brief the supply chain and set up checks to ensure the bridge is loaded as per the temp works design. The site team had good communication with the supply chain and the temp works team whilst developing the onsite scaffold.
"JMS site supervision – Geographical location of the works and existing workload resulted in the allocation of inexperienced site supervision with the added irregularity that the site supervisor could not drive. Coating services ltd - Subcontractors’ grit blasting resources were changed on more than one occasion during the works resulting in sporadic site progress and multiple requirements for JMS to brief site team and suffer delays associated with this. PM and Contract Manager to liaise on the appointment of suitable staff and where possible allocation of site supervisors to be based on them being familiar with the type of work being undertaken. Site supervision should be holders of current valid driving licenses. The works were small in nature and no consideration was given to the subcontractor changing the implementation team on numerous occasions. Although the end product was satisfactory suggest that when engaging this contractor in the future, a condition of placing an order with them must be their commitment to consistent and sufficient site resources."
All plant and equipment requirements were coordinated well and of satisfactory standard. Good communication between the site team and JMS plant results in no plant and equipment issues.
All materials required for the works procured without issue Good communication between the site team and JMS head office results materials purchased in time and to budget
Administration of contract and Change control managed efficiently . Good commercial control and forecasting by site team leads to accurate and timely resolution of final account.
Health and safety file submitted to correct timescales. Good communication between the site team and the doc controller make it possible for the Health and Safety file to be produced and submitted to the correct timescales.
"Minor Waste Management issue – When demobilisation took place of the onsite grit blasting enclosures, small quantities of contaminated grit blast media were left on site. Suggest that the JMS supervision are briefed on the possibility of waste blast media to be present on site after demobilising the encapsulation and carry out site inspection as soon as possible after the encapsulation has been removed to insist that the subcontractor removes all waste expediently."
"Heald Green Engaged NR Construction Manager months in advance of start on site and worked collaboratively to ensure he bought into what was a high risk methodology (ie. sheet piling adjacent to operational railway). Advanced deveg works also uncovered an unknown cable route which allowed time for them to be dealt with. Scheme completed as per programme. Kirkby in Furness Due to late Contract Award and NR’s requirement to complete by end of financial year, this scheme had to be completed throughout winter – not good for GB&P! Led to quality issues with the painting. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence."
"Heald Green UTX to be installed from station platform across to opposite platform within very short possessions. Kirkby in Furness Erecting an encapsulated scaffold in situ on an estuary led to weather issues, especially as the amount of kentledge required over-loaded the platform capacity. Open cut would be risky due to timescales, so we design an auger bored solution with caissons at either side to remove the need for temporary works designs. Was more expensive but gave us cost and programme certainty. If we had more time following contract award we could have looked into full weekend road closures at the start and end to lift the footbridge out and blast it in controlled factory conditions."
"All 3 projects were Build Only, although Heald Green did incorporate an element of Permanent Works Design – the auger bored UTX. This package was let to Donaldson Associates due to their extensive tunnelling/settlement calculation experience. We did not look elsewhere due to a lack of market knowledge and as such did not get commercial value for money from Donaldsons."
"All three projects incorporated a requirement for Temporary Works Designs. All were planned, designed, taken into use and dismantled with no issues and as per the JM “Design Control” procedure."
"Heald Green Sheet piling – SPI Auger bored UTX – AE Yates Auger bored UTX Design - Donaldsons Steelwork fabrication & craneage – Carvers. Kirkby in Furness Scaffold – Lyndons GB&P v- Coating Services. Overall what was a high-risk scheme went very well. We had an excellent site team, led by our most competent Site Manager at that time (Jason Tierney) and foreman (Sean McCann). We arranged for more compound space than NR thought necessary at the start, but once underway they agreed it was a good move. Not sure if we would be able to do now what we did then regarding the sheet piling installation during the current climate and interest in ALO Working! Lyndon Scaffolding were very poor and designed the scaffold without visiting the site. We only found out when they designed the temporary scaffold footbridge to be cited in the wrong place, at a location where there was not the room to build it. This set us back a few weeks. Poor management of sub-contractor. Coating Services were very good and repeatedly warned us the painting conditions/temperature would be out of spec. We in turn warned the client but they insisted it went ahead."
"Heald Green The project was managed in a collaborative manner from start to finish and regular communication between all parties meant change was effectively managed. No issues, although the remote location meant the NR team didn’t visit the site throughout the Construction phase. Monthly on-site progress meetings rather than in Square One helped with this Insist on a regular joint site visit."
"Quality of painting. As previously stated, no issues with what our s/c did as they warned us it would be out of specification."
"Silty water from piling works seeped through the ground and emerged at the rear of the platform. Good ground conditions meant the piles needed assistance from a high pressure water jetting system. The water appeared on the rear of the platform and once noticed, JM personnel controlled it then cleaned it up. Site team reacted well and were praised by NR."
Accurate setting out required for drilling anchors as little tolerance on brackets. Collision brackets unable to lift vertical due to centre of gravity and unable to lift close enough to viaduct wall. Templates made from 2mm steel for the drilling to ensure accurate setting out. Made one for drilling and then one for setting the anchors. Utilised 2No hiabs for a tandem lift.
All of the bolts had to be to a set tension and unable to get ratchet to certain parts of the gantry . Replaced bolts with TCB’s that are set to a tension and uses small tool to tighten allowing easier installation.
No lifting points designed for the vertical legs of the gantries. Had a couple of swivel ring eye bolts fabricated and bolted to the top of the support to lift it up square.
Used John Sutch cranes as previously installed earlier gantries hence utilised local knowledge and learning curve Used Vertical access for the anchors again worked on phase one so continuity of people.
Utilization of plant for working reducing scaffolding. No real issues Utilised a tele handler with man riding basket due to rough terrain and slopes to access the brackets without need for extensive scaffolding.
Used shawton engineering for structural steel. No issues. A minor issue with some galvanizing but rectified quickly with out delay.
Used Arups for the design works. Some of drawings ect slow to come through i.e afc drawings.
Agreement to chance bolts to TCBs for ease of installation and safer working method.
Used solo unit no issues.
Due to large volume of reactive works / emergency remits we have found it impracticable to produce contract programmes. This is an area in 2013 in which we can improve.
"The cabins provide by P&T have improved dramatically over the last 12 months but more improvements such as providing an complete set up inc, microwave, kettles, health and safety posters would be advantageous. Regular inspections are being carried out by Reg Davies to a high standard."
In the last 12 months we have established a document controller for the minor works project who has transformed the management of documents and drawings. The contract could perform better in the area of sub contract / design management and this is an area which we will concentrate in 2013..
We have recently completed several emergency jobs in places such as Nethertown and Mossley. Ian Spibey temporary works team produced first class documentation / temp works designs and this has been recognised by the client. Ian team have been actively involved at site level often supervising the works.
We have completed several large emergency projects this year often reacting in the middle of the night. The client recognises Murphy as the most responsive contractor and this is leading to more and more works. Due to the emergency works our core minor remits sometimes suffer delay.
We do feel that our P&T department could improve with more internal communication / honesty when deadlines cannot be met. The main issue with P&T is that when complaints/ issues are highlighted no improvements are made.
Our documentation controllers have improved our supply of requisitions to the various Murphy departments.
 We have developed a close working relationship with our emergency designers Coffey. Due to the minor nature of many of our remits we do not use a great number of subcontractors.
 Due to number of minor works remits now been tendered this has put a strain on the department. Debbie Platt deals well with the client and changes are monitored closely.
 No nonconformance were issued in 2013 on the minor works contract however moving forward we are promoting the use of Non Conformances / quality improvements.
There has been improvement in welfare facilities supplied but further improvements could be made.
 We are now inputting all of our waste transfer notes into the new smart waste database.
The minor works team continue to produce high quality works despite the added pressures of emergencies throughout the inclement weather of the last 6 months. All to often we dwell on the negatives rather than focussing on the excellent work that we do.
Slow progress due to half of the road closure. Organize full road closure to shorten the time to finalise works. On this occasion the Local Authority insisted on a half closure which made the works harder and the construction period longer.
Good cooperation with the designers. OPUS very helpful with sorting out day to day design problems on site. Opus are perceived as a very good designer and we work very well with the JMS teams.
Existing temp. service scaffold not suitable as a working platform for bricklayers. Scaffold should have been rearranged to be suitable as a working platform for rebuilding the pilasters after core possession.
Good balance achieved between site needs and cost effectiveness.
"Stand pipe not available from stores to hire Make sure foremen have standpipes available on jobs, where water is not supplied from the mains"
Good balance achieved between site needs and cost effectiveness No issues with materials quality or deliveries.
"Client demands on getting schemes designed and started on site within 3 months of Contract commencement. Due to rapid timescales, we proposed an alternative method of scoping sites. We (ourselves with our chosen designer RJM) visited 2 per day over an 8 week period producing reports each evening to maintain programme and flow of information. Having knowledge of all schemes very quickly allowed us to quickly produce a delivery programme which integrated design dates and took cognisance of disruptive possession availability, number of land owners/land access issues and ecological/environmental constraints. Complex schemes were pushed to the back of the programme and quick wins pulled to the front. The team also worked collaboratively with the Design Consultant, working from their office at least 1 day per week throughout the 20 month programme duration. This allowed issues/challenges to be identified and a way forward sought quickly with email correspondence and the associated delays. Conversations were not backed up with email and trust was allowed to flourish."
"Heavy plant operating adjacent to the operational infrastructure created a number of issues, but working within possession only would mean programme would increase twenty-fold. The ESP Earthworks team worked closely with our Temporary Works Department and designed a generic temporary catchfence design which enabled us to work on cuttings during the day and adjacent to the operational railway without fear of a catastrophic event. This design saved £millions and enabled us to deliver many more schemes than we might have done."
"Timescales required “quick wins” and NR’s existing design process didn’t allow for them. Our primary design partner RJM are a small outfit and felt they couldn’t accept all schemes we asked them to do as it would affect the quality of their performance. In conjunction with RJM, we introduced a new design format – Remit Verification Drawing and Schematic. The Client did not issue a remit, only mileages and a basic scope of works within a table. Options Stage was undertaken via workshops and discussions rather than reports took centre stage. All solutions were agreed verbally in large clusters at these sessions. We then produced a Remit Verification Drawing which in essence was a detailed “pictoral” remit following determination of the preferred option, which all parties signed up to to allow design to proceed quickly with a clear focus. This meant we had to go elsewhere and chose to go with Coffey Geotechnics. They performed extremely poorly in comparison, missed every signle submission deadline and were very expensive in the process. They were also the Designer at Bradwell Abbey, a site at which we had a major incident which could have had catastrophic consequences. We did not “co-locate” with them and didn’t work as closely as we did with RJM, and this may have been a factor in their under-par performance."
"Some cutting slopes were longer than the long reach’s arm, which presented a problem in achieving full sloipe length works during operational hours. Again, working closely with our in-house Temporary Works Design Team we produced a counter[1]balanced/winched excavator design which allowed a 13 tonne excavator to track/be winched down the face of the cutting by a 35 tonne excavator with secondary support cable in case of failure, and reach/excavate beyond the limits of a long reach excavator. This methodology was high risk, especially when working in tandem with the temporary catchfence, but it saved £millions and allowed programmes to be fast-tracked over and above what they might have been."
"Around 66% of the workbank was located north of Preston which presented problems with travel time and accommodation for our north west-based resource. We recruited in the Penrith/Carlisle area and started a number of ex-Stobart and Story management and labour to allow local personnel to work locally. We also opened an office in Penrith which meant staff didn’t have a 90 minute drive to Golborne (each way) saving both time and fuel, and reducing carbon footprint of the Contract."
20 months continuous Earthworks work meant we could look to purchase plant specific to this workstream. We purchased tracked dumpers and long reach excavators to maximise use of internal plant.
"Across the portfolio we procured hundreds of thousands of tonnes of aggregates which not only incurred significant cost but also led to a high carbon footprint and significant damage to approach roads to sites, meaning high reinstatement costs. Wherever possible we looked to plan to bring in materials/aggregates using engineering trains booked through NDS. We would then load spoil onto these trains, gaining what was in essence free materials and a free tip. Reinstatement costs were also massively reduced due to less traffic on the road and more via rail."
"Aggregate and muckaway costs over such a large portfolio of earthworks were extremely high. We could have managed this issue much more efficiently by using our bulk buying power to obtain better prices, and by letting muckaway packages as sub-contract rather than by the load. This cost us significantly at the large regrade schemes such as Griseburn and Langwathby. Since then we have looked to engage our procurement and waste departments early to ensure we can realise these efficiencies."
"Informal approach to Contract Management on both sides made dispute resolution difficult .The programme did not carry the weight it usually would as the portfolio was treated on a “win some, lose some” approach by both parties due to the speedy nature of the start up and subsequent delivery. Relationships maybe became over-friendly when they should have been kept a little “fresher”. We as a team were also criticised for not submitting Change Requests in a timely manner, and seemed to leave them until beyond Practical Completion before attempting to resolve them."
" No issues at all. Feedback from all parties within the geotechnical fold of NR stated that the ESP Earthworks was the most successful part of CP4 and the portfolio of works designed and delivered to the highest quality. Internally, NCR’s were raised early on with the P&T Department but were met with conflict and they quickly stopped, with a more informal approach to resolving issues taken."
"Generally performance was excellent in all of these areas and we received regular feedback to support this. The incident at Drigg (RRV parked on a buried troughing route) and the access issue at Cowburn (involvement of the ORR) could easily have been avoided, but both were superbly supported by Alan McDonough and his wider HSQE team and quickly closed out."
"Community engagement was undertaken wherever possible, and waste managed as well as possible. Granted lessons have been learned regarding letting it as a sub-contract package, but equally, letting a few schemes out to smaller civils contractors led to us learning about biomass and the savings that can be made through felling, chipping and selling chippings following tree felling & Deveg works as opposed to simply sending them away to landfill. We have learned from this and are currently implementing these positive lessons across CP5 schemes."
"The client and team were kept informed. Programme was reviewed day one and weekly thereafter. Action plan/ risk register was reviewed updated and issued weekly. Programme was feasible after first review. Letters were issued to the client to make sure that he was kept informed. Project team were not involved early even within Murphy. Enquiry came by unconventional means. Programme reviewed weekly one hour ax. Picked up risks early Format of programme was modified to be more sequential and user friendly, worked. NWR document control was not clear or understood properly. Conform programme day one with line by line review • Compile detailed risk register with actions assigned monitor, review and issue weekly • Make sure that the contract is understood and letters are issued to identify any possible issues. E mail may not be acceptable if used number and log in correspondence register. Team were keen to implement these controls elsewhere. Make sure that a PM is appointed day one so that ownership is clearly defined. Monitor programmes closely throughout. Make sure the programme follows the work flow rather than discipline. Team thought this very important. Meet with NWR and agree Project specific Hierarchy of sign off, critical control documents and the process of control."
"The preparation for cable pulling seemed over the top but paid dividends. Notification of change was timely and saved conflict. Particularly with such as brackets manufactured by us that were non compliant NWR were informed and agreed before we manufactured them but later rejected them as non compliant. Possession strategy was not suitable for our work scope, (unfortunately on WCML these were the best possessions times available). Installation strategy for rollers changed several times, excessive numbers, method of install. Wasted 2 weeks. NWR were not cooperative when reviewing documentation and TQ’s. Caused programme and cost issues. They also kept making changes and issuing uncontrolled documents to us. Planned each weekend possession in detail reviewed Monday. Material Control was good. • Cable delivery and inspection managed • Spare Pfister jointing kits ordered. • Ordered additional straight joints(of which 1 was used/needed) • Additional Pfisterer connection ordered due to difference in cable diameters. Detailed plan the position of each roller. • Visit site to make sure that conditions are suitable • Identify all changes in direction. Make sure that early w Make sure that the deadlines for NWR approval are clearly communicated to NWR before the contract is signed. • Agree that they will waive the review period and shorten the review times for this type of fast track. Write it down and agree it.arnings are in place and client is informed of any change by letter. • Make sure that the PM, Planner and QS are kept in the loop. Make sure that the possession strategy is robust pre contract. Make sure that the right people visit site together. • Use impact wrench for installation. Do this for all jobs. Make sure that NWR understand the importance and materials delivery schedule. • Agree inspection regime • Order any spares early can be long lead."
"Early walk out to confirm route saved abortive work by identifying hot spots and errors. Long lead time items were assessed for risk to Murphy and project and orders placed early before design fully approved if possible. McNicholas drawings issued by NWR were not accurate. Boundaries of our supply were not clear. NWR Drawings were generic some not signed off. Scope was not clearly defined. Bridge crossings had to be reworked, camera surveys were necessary. Led to NWR preferential engineering and additional cost. NWR were pedantic about submissions rejection on wrong numbers, abbreviations, wrong forms. Managed NWR to make sure that the design was signed off. PSP were difficult in the early days, came good in the end but we could not control them. Carry out site survey with client early • Record findings in detail • Communicate to Project and Client. Agree with NWR that they will give initial design feedback • Assess the risk of placing orders early • Place order once agreed with Project Manager. Pre contract award have NWR issue marked up boundary of supply drawings and clarify the scope. • Review drawings at site before finalising contract price or agree what constitutes a change. Make sure that scope is clearly defined pre contract. • Make sure that contract drawings are QA’d. Agree and document that this will not happen pre award. Build relationship with CEM/CRE to make sure we can influence them. Look at alternatives • In house maybe."
Right person for right job took some time but worked. Subbies also right. Start up fragmented because of misunderstanding of works. CEM/CRE competency Team dynamic was good everyone worked well together. Lack of resource on site meant FTN was affected. Due to late change in methodology more labour intensive. Methodology also changed several times because Tom was not available. Requirements were not clear. Agree team earlier and get them working together • QS appointed too late. Have detailed start up meeting to explain the works and roles and responsibilities etc. • Define project execution strategy at above meeting. Define day one in future. Make sure that the team is able to communicate with each other this type of project. Plan work /resources better earlier • Have more knowledge available early such as Tom O’Hare.
"Kelbrae were helpful particularly placing winch drilling rail. 1st shift RRV went to wrong place. Impact wrench for trombones etc saved loads of time. In house winches gave us flexibility. flexibility . In house rollers were advantage especially enclosed for changes of direction NWR HV cable free issue was late several different diameters. Needed special brackets, cleats and Pfister joints connectors didn’t fit caused delays. McNicholas raised route anti vandal brackets did not fit. NWR free issue not consistent, not timely always problematic. Drilling rail and traction bonding Murphy had no experience. Use them in future. Pre plan in more detail make sure work site is understood. Use in future. Note. Use in future. Confirm spec of cable with NWR day one • Make sure it’s all from one consignment/supplier. Sites check at the earliest any existing build. Deadlines written into contract. Train up in house people or bring in."
Difficult to manage PSP due to lack of expertise. PSP were difficult to manage/control. Poor interface management meant that Kelbrae were under resourced lat possession Xmas. Single sourcing imported risk. Asbestos removal term contract works. Pre tender estimate reasonably accurate. T’S and C’s back to back. Bring in Section HV commissioning capacity to supervise/monitor. Someone like Nick Beer. Plan work in more detail. Mark up Gantries day before possessions • Source alternatives. Obtain 3 prices. Noted.
NWR walkouts so far good feedback. Much was right first time. Planning and Murphy flexibility contributory factors. Cable issued by NWR could have caused major problems. Cleats etc specified by them did not fit. We struggled to source in time. Noted. Discussed above and Noted.
Installation of cable etc during the day increased production and was safer. Winches removed manual handling to a greater extent. Lubricant down ducts and applied to cable reduced resistance to pulling by 50%. Red Zone working on bridges caused problems. Noted. Use as preferred method to manual handling. Use going forward. Make sure that NWR are on board before we sign the contract.
Asbestos identified early followed process engaged framework contractor. • Noted.
"Regular team meetings communication and updates were applied and worked well. Team felt early involvement and consistent team was essential to success. Detailed early planning, resource allocation, clear lines of communication were identified as essentials by the team. Commercial should be involved more and earlier. Lack of HV competency a problem. Apply to other projects • Team noted that time may not be available. We agreed time should be found and would become available with good planning. Noted. Noted to do going forward. Train existing staff • Bring in expertise."
Planning team were not aware of the scheme during the tender period - Lack of knowledge and very few construction details makes it difficult for the planning team to produce the clause 14 programme. Management and updating of programme - Generally managed well with regular visits to site by the planning team for updates and for physical confirmation of progress. This also helped the planning team understand the methodology better. Clause 14 programme submitted late – Originally instructed by client to delay the programme as the delivery date could possibly change but when the date was confirmed the programme was not confirmed until enough information was available from the design team – this approach could lead to negative contractual issues. Suggest that large relatively schemes are planned by the planning team at tender stage. General perception has been that the estimating team will be more inclined to accept reduced programme timescales in order to secure work leading to very tight delivery programmes once secured which the planning team do not agree with. The condensed delivery programme had a massive effect on subcontract procurement and missed opportunities to extract market value from the supply chain. Continue to engage the planning team and invite to site visits and progress meetings. Continue to draw up and adhere to a long term plan for programme updates. Submit clause 14 programme to timescales even if this means having much more generous individual design and construction item durations.
"Site / Office set-up - including security – Good office set up on site which please the client but identified as being over the tender budget. Surveying Setting out – extremely good engineering control on site leads to very good quality end product. Construction method – Soil Nails - The design solution was vastly over budget and difficulties during installation result in very large quantities of grout loss. Construction method – Reinforced concrete - generally accepted as good. Construction method – Reinforced concrete – In-sitex liner incorrectly fitted leads to non conformance not highlighted by pre pour inspections. Inspections – Good regular inspections by JMS COW leads to client peace of mind and no issues during site installation. Core possession work – Good planning leads to successful bridge installation during the core possession. Commissioning Testing – no issues on commissioning as a result of robust inspections and quality control. Feed back to the estimating team that the quality of office set up expected by the client needs to be budgeted for. A lot of effort placed on integrating the Pway engineering control and the Civils engineering control. The active development of this by the management team leads to a good relationship between both engineering teams and the control of setting out on site. Review the need for soil nail works on future similar schemes and try to design out by other methods. Challenge soil nail specification when possible – in this instance programme pressure did not allow for value engineering. Good end product delivered by subcontract team. Well managed by the site team. Successfully delivered large volume single sided concrete pour to abutment stems. Successful development of temporary works and formwork construction to be briefed to other site teams. Brief non conformance to other site teams in order to avoid similar issue in the future. Continue to plan for regular inspections of off-site manufactured elements. Good teamwork between JMS, Client and subcontractors delivers robust thorough core possession methodology. Continue to implement robust quality control."
"Purchasing Lead times – design delivered late. Design Change – The chosen design option required the design of an extensive foundation solution – this had been significantly underestimated at the tender stage. Management of subcontract designers – process developed to include 4 separate external design teams, generally good control of the designs by the JMS team. Drawing Control – generally managed and distributed well. With hindsight the duration for the F001,F002 and F003 design deliverables was too ambitious as a result of accepting reduced programme timescales from the client. Estimating team to be briefed that a bridge of this complexity requires more time to design than allowed in the tender programme. Brief other design and estimating teams that the foundation design requirements for a bridge of this type will be extensive and need to be budgeted for. This may require significant design development reserves within the estimate. IDC process implemented well on the scheme. Continue to implement JMS procedures."
"TWC Permits to Load / Strike Suitability of Temporary Works – JMS temporary works procedures followed rigorously which gave the client a lot of confidence in the site team. Access Ramp – no temporary works design was carried out for the ramp, consider carrying out design on future installations. Some F003 Temporary works designs not produced to timescales. Continue to implement JMS procedures and brief other teams on the positive effects on the client when these procedures are evident on site. Brief other implementation teams on the requirements for a simple temporary works design for access ramps. Brief the importance of delivering temporary works designs to clients timescales."
Labour – project managed out of Golborne resourced with labour from other regional offices. Competence and Training - Labour from other regions not PTS trained – project needs to train and provide rail PPE for the site delivery team. Competence and Training – TVPs required for labour with no rail experience. Labour – administration of wages was disjointed/difficult as labour was from various regional offices with different wage and bonus structures. Good attitude demonstrated by JMS management and labour for the project. Good example of inter regional office collaboration. Brief estimating team that budget for PPE and training needs to be allocated for remote locations with local JMS staff which are not rail experienced. Very large PPE budget required for the core possession as works carried out by a large team with existing standard green PPE. Client slightly concerned by the number of TVPs required for the staff undertaking the works during the core possession. Strive for similar wage structure across all regions?
"Hire / Off-hire – administration and servicing of plant disjointed as project managed from Golborne but majority of plant serviced from other regions. Plant hire – no feedback given to the site team when plant ordered about if and when plant will be delivered and the rates for hire. Plant hire – demolition jaws utilised for the dismantling of the existing bridge – good choice of plant. Off Hiring Plant – plant hire sheets often 2/3 weeks behind actual live hire - makes current live hire cost assessment difficult. Develop plant procedures to include a confirmation of receipt of request for plant hire, and provide feedback on who will deliver and when plus the weekly hire rate. Health and Safety risks associated with burning operations avoided by the choice of method/plant for dismantling the bridge. Improve plant hire procedure to develop live hire data base."
"Requisitioning – no feedback provided to site team after requisition made to detail delivery date or cost. Storage and Stores Control – generally handled well on site. Long delivery materials identified and ordered with good time. Develop purchasing procedures to acknowledge receipt of requisition followed by confirmation to the site team of when delivery will be made including unit cost. VIPA baseplates, bridge bearings, Precast concrete units and steel for bridge successfully identified as early requirement for procurement."
Lead times – condensed programme periods make it difficult to extract best prices from the market. Management / supervision of (including communication). Competence & Experience. Many subcontract orders placed at a loss due to the changes from tender. Little or no opportunity to negotiate orders down due to programme pressures. Good culture of collaborative working fostered on site. Generally subcontractors chosen to execute the works demonstrate good competence and experience.
"Tender / Estimate – Option 3 of tender chosen by the client which was the option least developed by the estimating team – the repercussions of this chosen option were not fully understood by the estimating team resulting in many subcontract orders placed at a loss. Administration of contract – generally handled well by the site team. Change control – handled efficiently. Communication (including document control, progress meetings). Final Account – early development of final account. Estimating team to fully understand pricing implications of the various options proffered to the client. Efficient contract administration develops good collaborative relationship between JMS and client. Management team identifies early that the many and complex changes to the contract need to be recorded and notified diligently. Good reporting format adopted by the site team with regular updates between site and commercial team to capture all entries in the CR register. Good collaborative relationship between JMS and client. Good control of site records makes the early agreement of the final account a possibility."
Although NCRs and CARs are known to have occurred these do not appear to be recorded on the JMS system. Brief and train site delivery teams on the JMS quality procedures on NCR and CAR requirements.
Health and Safety – large project delivered with only 2 minor incidents. Welfare Facilities – good quality welfare facilities set up on site. Health and safety – good support and advice from the H&S team and the Culture development team. Continue to train and educate site teams and induct into the culture programme to maintain good safety performance. Continue to provide good quality welfare facilities. Continue to provide good support to the delivery teams.
Incidents- flooding incident caused by stats authority whilst carrying out work on behalf of JMS. Waste Management – handled well throughout the works. Brief other site teams as there appears to be confusion on the CDM hierarchy when stats authorities are working on JMS sites. Environmental incident caused by Yorkshire Water whilst carrying out a service diversion paid for by JMS is still ultimately a JMS incident which needs recording and reporting. Continue to implement the JMS waste procedures.
Statutory authorities – management on site – planning and management of stats works on site challenging Try to develop robust programme for all stats diversions required and ensure lead in times are identified and accounted for
Due to change in scope of the works program changed. Originally installing lift using piling method but changed due to site conditions to installing caissons. No initial buy in from Network rail regards the Caisson method as it was design and build. The issue regards change in scope still outstanding following the scheme completion. If site had waited for approval for the caisson method works would still be on going. Issue was from Grip 4 stage when there was in sufficient information to progress with the piling option and too many risks/unknowns hence different methodology adopted.
Removing and transporting materials through live station on island platform without possessions as rule of route only available. In excess of 100 ton of material to remove through the station with access at max to 1.6m wide. Working on a live platform reinforced concrete works and excavation works. Segregation of public. Sinking shaft and control of verticality etc. Design and utilised a Gantry crane on the platform. This enabled the excavation works to be done during normal daytime working and then removal of material on an evening. All materials went through the station subway. The gantry crane also meant that due to heavy ground conditions mini ex could be lowered into the shaft for breaking and excavating. Created high street environment utilising heras fencing. Due to exposed nature of the site and wind the heras fencing was supported by cast in scaffold tubes. These were cast in line with tactile paving slabs to limit the amount of reinstatement works. As they were installed in the tactile paving only slabs every 3m were removed and could easily be replaced. The first ring sections excavated and then ring beam cast to secure the first layer of rings in place. All subsequent rings then followed the first rings which were cast in place and fixed.
AFC drawings late to finalise due to insufficient grip 4 design. Has resulted in a change of methodology and unresolved agreement as to additional costs. Buildability issues and queries. Murphys design and build but took over design at Grip 4 stage at which time there was insufficient information to progress to afc stage. Motts were the designer Network rail had in place and following various amendments and alterations of the drawings construction had already started before afc finally signed off. In order to progress the works construction started until afc were finalised but has resulted in unresolved change request for change in design. A lot of the finer detail on the afc drawings was queried regards some of the finishes. Review had been carried out on the drawings but several items missed regards when building. Some items left on drawing as to be confirmed on site. Technical queries designer reluctant to answer unless costed. If genuine query regards the drawings then should be no charges as the design should be complete and all details should be shown
Creating high street environment on live platform exposed to elements. Protection of the public in subway whilst platform works commenced. Limiting the amount of scaffolding in the shafts for both shaft and brickwork. Utilised heras fencing on cast in scaffold tubes to secure in place. Limited room taken up on edge of platform maintaining maximum working area. Scaffold tubes provided trip free support. Utilised a crash deck which was an extension of the existing subway roof therefore not impacting on head height. Access in subway narrowed but maintained at a comfortable 1.5m.wide. The crash deck also doubled up as access area for materials up and down the platform at night as it was specifically designed to have a removable panel to allow the gantry crane to lower and raise items when the station was shut. In order to create suitable platforms for both bricklaying and lift installation scaffold tube sliders were utilised. These sliders installed at bricklaying lifts mean that whilst bricklaying the sliders could be extended back to the extremities to form a complete closed platform and then when lift works started the sliders could be retracted to ensure that the lift engineers had sufficient room around the scaffold to install brackets etc. The slider rails would be useful for under soffit works ect as they can cantilever 1-3 boards out so as works progress platforms can be extended or retracted to suit without need of rebuilding the scaffold configuration.
Condition of equipment. Items of hired plant that are used on site often run out of pat testing cert from hired companied if on long term hire. Should hire companies be sending out their own elecs to re pat test their equipment or is that with the sites?
"Number of requisitions raised and queries raised. Making good heavily trafficked areas. Making good aco drains. Excess concrete waste. As with all schemes numerous requisitions produced. Some requisitions produced that could of been collected with a call off order from local builders merchant. Suggest call off orders on all sites. If call off orders set up for the following items: General consumables i.e parkers greenhams, building general i.e travis, fuel, skips, drinking water septic tank empty, concrete, stone i.e type 1 then alot of requisitions would not be required as most of the items would be covered under the initial 8No above. Would reduce time for sites producing, doc control and purchasing time. As it happens with general building materials sites ring to check availability anyway with local say Travis and then are ringing office for order number then office ring keyline who ring travis branch. Al could be saved by just having call off orders for say £300 limit at a time. In order to make good area of the station heavily trafficked as it was only route to and from work site utilised drive-revive. It is a painted on bitumen paint that once the surfaced is washed down and lattice removed it coats the surface with a bituminous paint that brings the colour back to the surfacing whilst also adding a protection layer to the surface. As with above tired aco lids painted but used ‘black jack’ paint to refurbish old lids. Not really used on this site but idea could be utilised elsewhere was to line 1 ton dumpy bag with visquene as empty excess concrete into the bag rather than in area that it then has to be broken up. The bag can then be lifted straight onto a wagon as required. Weight in back would need to be monitored."
Specialist items such as security doors and cladding systems. Lead in times for security doors and lack of response regards the stainless steel cladding resulted in delays to works. Potentially should of been ordered sooner but with doors genuine failure regards subcontractor initially with the doors meant had to change supplier. With stainless steel panels lack of any reply regards the queries that went out resulted in Stannah installing. Quotes should be obtained at start of contract before construction works start by buying department.
Unresolved change controls. Change in design installation piling to caissons still unresolved. As design and build murphys have proceeded with build based on new installation method but no agreement with Network rail regards the change. All due to lack of design information and adequate design at grip 4 stage which is when Murphys took control. In order to reduce any further delays construction works continued with the installation based on new design with approval in principle only from Network Rail.
O and M manual and getting lifts into operation Regular coordination meetings held between Murphys/Stannah and Butler and Young. Network rail invited but did not often appear. Coordination meetings held to highlight any issues and ensure a smooth handover. Due to lack of involvement of Network rail the actual handover of the lifts did not run smoothly regards to getting the lifts onto the asset register. Butler and Young consultant reluctant to sign off until various forms were sent individually all requested at the last minute which delayed the handover of the lifts. Murphys has tried to take lead in absence of Network rail coordination with their consultant Butler and Young.
"Limited room for cabins etc. Minimising disruption to station and public. Recording Weekly checklists for mandatory items. Utilised a redundant arch for the site offices and created canteen area and office within the arch. Some of larger concrete pours done at night to reduce disruption. Utilising the stickers for weekly check on i.e fire extinguishers, first aid etc was good as so often occurs they are checked as required but then not recorded in the file this way they are recorded as you go around so that if missed off the sheet you can always refer back to the sticker on equipment."
During the contract there were no issues with the programme and the project was completed on time. Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. Due to the early contractor involvement at planning stage and site management being allowed to think outside of the box plus co-operation of the client and all interested parties the contract was a success. Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals.
No major issues were encountered with all aspects of the contract. Good site team was employed with good communication between both night and dayshifts. Site team were allowed to refine the construction process as the contract progressed.
Overall the design was robust and free from any major alterations which helps the construction team plan out in advance all work activities without fear of alteration and change.
Site had a designated TWC who monitored all temporary works issues and ensured compliance with company policy.
"Site management were left largely free to pick the site team they required to complete the project, this team delivered the job very successfully."
Changes in the plant hire operation in Golborne during the contract have started to be noticed on a site level with a much improved service being noticeable. More needs to be done regarding location of internal plant items including vans though.
"Again the second half of the contract was affected by the buying department undergoing some internal changes so lead times suffered as a result, lately the system seems to be getting back on track due to new recruits and the department taking a more professional view to its task."
"Site based QS proved invaluable towards procurement and management of sub-contractors, instead of just visiting once every few weeks he was largely on site and felt part of the team."
Due to nature of the target cost contract it is not in Murphy’s interest to highlight any non-conformances to the client so any remedial works that have been carried out (there have not been many) have not been recorded or highlighted.
A good site set up was carried out and benefited all site based operatives and portrayed a professional image to the traveling public as the offices where in a highly visible location.
Waste management was effectively dealt with by the site waste representative and the more professional office based team in Golborne.
"Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence. Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals."
"Single office and stores by JMS. Security by Viking, nights Mon to Fri and 24 hr at week_x0002_ends. Ideal given limited area on site. TOPO and GPR surveys carried out given vital information not provided by NwR buried services info. Poor Buried services info from NwR. All setting out by JMS site engineer. All statuary inspections carried out for concreting and drainage works. New dust Suppression works, weighbridge relocation and lighting columns commissioned. New drainage works jetted and camera survey carried out prior to hand over."
"Minimal due to design changes and extra works. Numerous, mostly generated from site due to poor design and initial site survey."
TWD for shuttering carried out by suppliers. Remaining TWD carried out in house. All permits required in place.
"TWD for shuttering carried out by suppliers. Remaining TWD carried out in house. All permits required in place. Used JMS personnel where available, supplemented by Subcontract labour. All resources were competent, well trained and experienced within their own field"
Hired plant adequate and certified.
" Insufficient due to late start on site. Due to changes and little storage area, same material had to be re ordered. Quality of kerbs procured was poor. Due to JMS purchasing policy. Dedicated storeman controlling stocks. Very little wastage, any surplus used else where."
"Managed well, with all subcontract work being carried out efficiently and to cost."
Client unsure of quantities required as yard cleaning and site investigation not carried out sufficiently. Adequate Regular progress meetings and site visits. Final account almost complete.
Good records kept with H&S File almost complete. Minimal snagging due to high standards of workman ship and early rectification where required.
"Site office and stores, Gated facility with designated traffic routes, Provided by Depot with canteen, toilets and drying room available. One minor accident with no lost time. Over 30,000 man hours."
"Regular environmental checks carried out on Gresty Brook. Asbestos found on site in excavation, dealt with by professional contractor. Good with all records maintained."
Working relationship with all parties involved. Excellent working relationship throughout the duration of the contract so increasing Client confidence.
Tender programme did not allow sufficient time for installation or any float for delays. More involvement with construction team at tender stage to obtain a more realistic programme.
Better research into line blockage availability should have bed carried out at tender stage. Additional costs were incurred for night time working.
As the issues were caused by the clients nominated supplier any delays/ lost time was recovered from the client by a series of variations.
Training of operatives to install the ramp sections. Using fixing gangs from our supplier on a sub-contracts basis with JMS supervision and safety critical support. As part of the supply contract we were provided with advisors who worked with our installation teams for an initial period. This provided site support until our own fixing teams were competent to fix the units independently. This was utilised during the early stages in the North West and proved to be profitable and enabled us to meet the programme dates. The costs for the same teams to travel to other regions was prohibitive and resulted in a downturn in productivity until we could assemble a second JMS installation gang.
"As part of our contract materials had to be collected from the nominated fabricator and transported to site by JMS. Control of hauliers. Delays due to site issues and possession planning caused delays which resulted in the ramp sections having to be stored and handled twice. This resulted in additional costs for storage and haulage. By using a dedicated driver, controlled by project team, and an internally hired wagon we were better able to react to changes more efficiently and mitigate costs."
Under estimating of installation costs. More involvement from project team to produce a more realistic tender figure and programme.
Close call potential near miss. Reliance on Agency safety critical staff while working in other regions resulted in a potential near miss. This delayed the programme by several months while an investigation was completed. This resulted in additional costs for storage and the re-deployment of the installation teams.
The programme was done and was being updated due to the unknown ground conditions. The progress got delayed as we were let down by the sub contractors not delivering materials on time. We tried to mitigate the delays by working a few days of night and day shifts as the work could not be carried out continuously due to HAVS . Ensure good and reliable Subcontractor are engaged and subcontractors follow correct quality procedures. And also they are engaged well in early stages of the project.
Track monitoring was carried out to ensure no settlements occur during the excavations . Setting controls. Inspection and testing Controls were prepour checks and post pour checks were carried out during the full construction of the project. Engineering controls were maintained and controlled well. Track monitoring was carried out during the phase of the project and were submitted to NWR on a daily basis. The design requested for a F3 finish but with tight site constraints this was not achieved. Murphys do not have many skilled labour resources and relied on Agency labour but would have been better to subcontract the concreting works to come up with a better design and construction process.
"support was very good. Design delivery was late by a month due to various changes requested by Network rail. Wilde’s were the designers on the project, Some of the queries which required urgent responses were dealt with quickly."
The temporary works design was one of the reason s for the delays . The temporary works design made the work more complicated to carry out the excavation. Hoarding were temporary works designed and approved by temp works coordinator.
"Staff Competence, Training, Experience .No skilled labour available and had to depend on Agency labour. Skilled labour required to achieve the correct quality."
Plant dept cooperated well to hire plant and offhired to issues on site with space restriction.
Main issue on site was storage of materials due to live station. Materials had to be stored in the kenedy road Yard. Materials were to be collected as required than ordering in surplus.
Subcontractors have not performed very well in the material delivery. Delays due to incorrect methodology used by the subcontractors. Subcontractors were sent the correct information but we have found the quality was not very good and snagged it and subcontractors had to do some remedial works.
Managed by QS with all variations and changes to the design. Some of the variations have been accepted by Network rail.
 All prepour checks recorded and cube strengths passed.
Very tight and limited welfare facilities and had to stagger breaks to accommodate operatives on site.
"Bridge works particularly involving the public highway usually includes utilities diversions sometimes with difficult temporary works solutions. The time for resolution is always under estimated by the Project/ Client. Hence when the implementation phase starts there can be immediate programme impacts. Client and Murphy over promising on delivery. On this project The client advised the local authorities that road closures and completion which were impossible. Murphy then compounded it by having the wrong competency advise them this was acceptable. Over the last few projects including Henrietta Street Murphy has become involved early with the client to survey, assess and start negotiations with the providers. Simply identifying and locating stats by more intrusive survey has saved valuable project time. It also prevents any abortive design works associated and can help determine the best solution for the deck and any temporary works. The team felt this should be the norm on any job going forward if at all possible. Offer our clients a service that will have a construction person available to advise and attend at the local authority if necessary to advise on these critical matters. Setting too high expectations early embeds them and causes unnecessary conflicts that should be avoided."
"Delivery of bridges relies on key suppliers such as Shay Murtagh (R.C.), Jamestown Profiling (steel filler beams) Ainscough (Cranes) and the scaffolding suppliers. Their performance determines our success. To date single sourcing has been used with all its associated problems for compliance. To date single sourcing has been used with all its associated problems for compliance with procurement. It was suggested that frameworks be put in place with performance requirements and agreed rates, so that both us and our suppliers have certainty and we will get the quality of supply we need."
"At the early stages of design important decisions are made that are sometimes difficult and costly to undo. Designers are experts in their own fields but have limited understanding of buildability. This was evident on this project by some of the issues arising. Example sill beams had to be redesigned; piling method could have been improved. There are separate site visits by the individual parties at the early stages and during design but particularly at the early stages. Things are missed, surveys inadequate and solutions difficult to build. At F00001 and F0003 (Concept/Preliminary) the right people should be involved at the right time. Our construction teams to be included at the early stages as advisors. Offer the service to our client. Suggest that on all future visits there are Multi Skilled Visits which include all necessary parties. One visit following a structured approach to identify any survey works, third party issues, stats issues, access points, lay down areas, site compound areas and so on. This will save abortive works such as with Henrietta compound being too small and in the wrong place."
The success of this project has much to do with our in house resources providing continuity and retention of valuable lessons and knowledge from previous jobs. In the early days client expectation was that numerous bridges could be at the same stage of build at the same time. They did not consider our capacity. Recently this has improved and hopes are it will continue to do so. We have agreements with agencies for safety critical staff that send people that are not familiar with the area or site. Under our procurement policy we are unable to deviate. Going forward can we keep the same people together and expand our capacity around them so that the pressure is not so continuous and intense. Can we make sure we keep the client well informed of our capability and capacity so that he fully understands what we do and why we are doing it. Is it possible to insist on familiarity as part of competency. Is there any way on critical possessions we can deviate without all the burocracy.
An expeditor has been used to monitor Shay Murtagh it has been a success. Good expeditors will feed back where the supplier is not performing and just as important if we are not performing. Can we consider this approach on other remote or critical suppliers.
"Site managers have no working budgets issued to them; Consequently they do not know what they are monitoring costs against. In addition they do not have access to their costs which prevents them knowing the status of current spend. Contracts Manager to issue budgets, Site teams to monitor and report against them having access to live cost info. An outcome from this meeting is that the Project Manager, Ops Manager, site manager and commercial team will meet more regularly to drill down on spends and where the money is going."
"Community engagement was a great success due to everyone willing to go that extra mile and become involved with assistance from the CR team in the office. We were able to keep the road closed longer but reopened the bridge two weeks early. Only one complaint about some signage a great testament to the team. Plan the community engagement early, have the team from Golborne help and push the PR. Involve the client and all the other stakeholders early get their buy in."

"■ Late engagement by NWR – all long lead items still delivered on time ■ Collaboration with piling contractor ■ Opening of footbridge early reduced complaints ■ Completed as per contract completion date ■ Keller Geotech very good for piling. Approach, entrance and exit to scaffold, needs to be more detailed providing corner information early on – project team working with temp works Service diversions to meet programme – outage times moving ■ Cabin set up moved – should have put it where it ended up. Service diversions to meet programme – outage times moving ■ Cabin set up moved – should have put it where it ended up."
"Putting in precast retaining walls rather than brick saved on programme ■ Barriers made to clip onto steel beams improved edge protection we will utilise in future ■ Bronto 34 Hiab baskets worked well and will be re[1]used – cost effective against safety critical. Look into midweek possession times to minimise issues in access on red zones and ensure we are covered with safety critical ■ Copings continue to be an issue with S. Murtagh o Needs picking up before leaving Ireland – introduce copings to trial erection – take Kieran around bridges to see issues – identical moulds? ■ Ensure land accesses in place prior to getting on site. ■ Poor rebar design – more interaction required early on. Buildability reviews – programme and cost implications ■ Ensure designers are not overloaded. Temporary edge protection fixed to new bridge components (parapet beams)saving time and improving safety Consider using Bronto Hiab Basket when working rail side on parapets to point up coping, aply sealant etc. This is cost efficient when compared to RRV MEWPS etc. Reiterate to precast concrete supplier the need to improve the quality of copings produced (Shay Murtagh, Ireland) Ensure all 3rd party agreements are in place early especially if highway lift is part of works (retaining walls and their foundations are required which can impede into other land owner properties. Check interface with reinforcement between precast units and insitu units, these can be problematic during the core possession and difficulties should be designed out."
Murphy to issue an ‘Items to be covered’ on future topo surveys – outline minimum requirements. ■ Murphy PM to speak to all parties to find out their requirements prior to topo ■ Murphy ECI worked well – needs to be refined to ensure we get it right first time ■ Ensure we get lifting equipment right at target cost. Poor topo – Murphy to check on future schemes ■ Edge beam weights keep increasing as design was developed – needs bigger cranes but these have smaller reach and cost implication ■ NWR personal preference – challenges ■ Estimating to construction hold staged constructability reviews at estimating stage. JMS to produce list of Topo survey requirements. Ensure designers are fully aware of precast concrete components max weight requirements to be within capability of crane capacity. Do not allow design development to increase the max stated weights.
■ Edge protection for precast concrete parapet beams worked well and will be re used. As noted previously.
"Utilise JMS for resources to reduce reliance on agency labour. ■ Need proactive management of bricklayers and joiners, no continuity ■ Doc controller sacked half way through and no replacement. Use JMS operatives and safety critical operatives where ever possible."
Murphy P&T excellent at getting plant and equipment to site when needed Plant off hire poor documentation ■ Cross hire by crane company – early engagement and reassurance with Ainscough required. Need improvements in real time reporting of plant and associated cost reporting for internal plant hire.
■ Shay Murtugh getting a bit presumptuous – need to be made aware will be going out for other prices ■ Weekly call offs supposed to be issued – we need these to stop programme implications ■ Some prices seem extortionate e.g. copers and chambers – need buyers to go out for 3 prices on everything.
■ Use Keller again ■ Bricklayers very good quality but expensive ■ Engagement and management improved. ■ As contract was awarded late we paid over the odds and chasing orders – early engagement ■ Wouldn’t use Datum track Monitoring again. Keller Geotechnique performed well installing the micro piles and will be invited to price for future piling works. Track monitoring reporting was problematic with Datum track monitoring.
Stats management ■ First set of target cost we have done – gone well and paid costs – good relationship. ■ Late award ■ Risk on stats we do much more than required as we need to keep on cost and counter charge. Target Costing Estimate proved accurate. Better recording of Statutory Authority works required for any possible counter charge claims.
No real issues ■ Happy with precast except for copers ■ Happy with insitu brickwork ■ Happy with surfacing.
Can cabins be plug and play? Current costs for hard wiring every time ■ Poor internet connection[1]issues repeated on other contracts ■ Housekeeping a continued issue ■ X2 accidents (fingers) -1 RIDDOR Internet connections continue to be problematic unless the site has a hard wired BT connection.
Recycled water ■ Identified knotweed issue with sighting cabins and moved them immediately ■ Only 1 complaint ■ Engagement with local schools. Obtained 2 consents we didn’t use. Engagement with local community and schools were well received and welcomed by all. Obtained water discharge consent for piling operations but did not require to discharge water to local combined sewer – recycled water after going through settlement process. Well received by EA.
■ Security issues quickly resolved ■ Positive client feedback.
The scheme was on programme until the badgers were discovered. This delay meant that the grass seed could not be laid on time. However all other activities were broadly carried out in their assigned timescales .Involvement from the whole team in development of the programme led to buy in from all and this led to it been followed right the way through the job. The scheme was ready for de-mob when badgers we discovered.
Engineering control and method of works deemed to be very good on this scheme A competent Engineer is to be used on all schemes. Early buy in from the whole team to agree the method of works to be carried out all schemes.
The design was completed by RJM and was very constructible. They were approachable through the construction process. We would recommend using RJM again.
The JMS temporary works team did a good job. The temporary works process was followed through correctly and all documentation kept up to date. Site visits by the temporary works teams will help with ensuring the design is adequate and the proper process is put in place and adhered to.
There was a lack of adequate JMS resource for this scheme. There was no Site Manager and in-experienced foreman to start with who was not helped by the work ethic of some of the some operatives .The Site Engineer became the Site Manager and drafted in a more established team to get the works completed in a timely manner. Schemes should not be started if there is not the adequate resource as this generally leads to poor performance and reputational damage.
There was an issue with internal off hire of plant. A meeting involving the delivery team and the P+T team resolved this issue.
All materials were delivered on time. Consumables of low value that needed to be bought at short notice from local retailers had to undergo the bureaucracy of larger purchases. This led to the team having to buy items themselves and claiming back. Good communication with the buying department was key to the positive outcome. We recommend that a purchase order be placed in the local hardware store for consumables with the Site Manager/Foreman keeping a logbook for what is purchased.
RJM were the designers and the feedback is that they were good. VA carried out the de-veg works and the feedback is that were good. TA Law did a very good job of the dry stone walls. We recommend using them again.
There was an omission of the reinstatement works for the grass seeding in the original price. There was adequate commercial involvement throughout the scheme. The QS was updated regularly ensuring good commercial governance of the scheme. The lack of adjudication contributed to the reinstatement works been missed.
No QA’s raised on this scheme. H&S file was submitted in a timely manner but designer held this up also producing the as build drawings. Site Manager to complete H&S file before moving onto next job.
Site set-up was very good. There were no incidents or accidents on the site. Efficiencies were achieved by running two sites close together and this scheme used both compounds. The programme was achievable and the design was well thought out. Designs always need to be challenged so that we are given the safest option to build.
A badger sett was discovered during the build stage and this was managed well with the JMS environmental team and Pearce. Works were stopped immediately once the badgers were discovered.
"Project Integration including other sites, contractors and haulage. NR led a proactive approach to inclusion of all the parties by making sure everyone was talking to each other. NR organised and led inter industry integration meetings to keep everyone informed about the works. There were weekly integration meetings from the start that promoted inclusion and shared information. Unanimous opinion that this element worked well. • Always consult as part of the inter industry review • All projects arrange Project Integration meetings, making sure that the right people attend to keep everyone informed."
"Robust Programming. It was agreed that on Chorley Tunnel the contract programme was challenged and reviewed by a collaborative team that included all the right people. In particular the site teams and supply chain. This meant that the sequencing of the works was more efficient and high risk areas were known. Problem areas were given some float wherever possible. Daily focused site briefings identified tasks not finished and tasks for that day. The programme should be challenged early by the project delivery team to confirm its integrity. • Compilation of the programme should include all the relevant people particularly the designer, supply and site teams. • Buy in and collaboration on the programme is essential. • Regular updates, weekly, daily look aheads should be the norm."
"Not enough attention was paid to the smaller elements of works on site both from a design and quality point of view. Discussions centred around the team concentrating on the critical sections of works to the expense of the other areas. The example of brickwork to the top of the retaining walls was discussed in detail and identified that; • The design was not detailed enough and was difficult to build. • Lack of supervision on the brickwork on the top of the retaining walls and the other small sections. • Wrong brick was used Stonework to arches Rebar between mortar joints was not installed because the original design would not work. This was not communicated either to NR or the designer but works went ahead regardless. The original design was not practical. In the case of the brickwork, a subcontractor design was used which was not verified by the original designer. The interface was not managed effectively. • All areas of the works however insignificant should be part of the buildability review in some detail. • Reviews of the design should consider buildability for all work items. • When design issues arise the designer should be leading their resolution. • Subcontractor design should be reviewed by the designer. • NR should be kept fully informed of any significant deviations from the design. • TQ process must be adhered to so that competent people take decisions. • The Quality and Inspection and test plans must be managed more closely. • Materials control should be in place at site level to make sure that materials comply with the spec."
"Need to have the site team involved earlier and briefed on risk. Extensive discussion about the communication of residual design risk. Designers identify in the DRA and on drawings but the risks are quite often not fully understood. Criticality of certain work items, in this case the notching of the tunnel, was not communicated effectively to the members of the site team physically carrying out the works. Designers should attend at site to explain the design and the risks • Designers should visit site monthly on this type of project to engage with the site team and discuss risk, issues and change."
Good proactive teamwork. Strong leadership backed up by strong relationships meant that everyone was involved from the start. This led to a strong team spirit and everyone buying into collaborative working. All parties were involved at the start including the supply chain. Efforts were made to involve the RAM who when attending at site was positive and supportive. • Early involvement of all the parties • Have consistent teams with strong relationships. • Involve the site teams at the earliest opportunity.
"Preparation works in advance of the blockade successfully carried out based on real information. The team spent valuable time on early planning. They targeted the critical areas and planned in detail well in advance of the 6 weeks blockade. Additional survey works were identified and undertaken which enabled some de-scoping of extent of the soil nailing the works This was possible because the right people were involved in the planning and risk reduction process. Critical work items which needed to be carried out in 54hr possessions prior to the blockade were carried out effectively. • Involve the right people in the early planning of the works include site and the supply chain. • Identify key high risk work activities and plan to deliver these early • Question the programme, review the level of detail in the surveys is it still appropriate is there enough."
Poor quality of PCC units. Pre Cast Concrete Units – Shay Murtagh – Final Site Inspection and Receipt at Site Inspection was not completed. Poor quality ladder beams were delivered with inadequate cover to reinforcement and these were installed. Some factory inspection was carried out but feed - back was not detailed enough. Site inspection on the delivered units focused on the setting out of the VIPA inserts and not on the cover to reinforcing. Critical items to have thorough inspection when delivered to site. • Consider employing a local expeditor.
"Change in WPP methodology for notching the tunnel wall was not adhered to. Lack of understanding of the risk. There was much debate on the poor understanding of the strength gain for the grouting requirement that was not understood by the installation team. This led to non-adherence to the WPP which itself had been changed signed off but not communicated to the installer at the sharp end. Control mechanisms did not work as people pushed on to achieve the programme and quality suffered • Proposed that for critical WPP works more attention is given to communicating the obvious risk. • Changes to the original WPP were carried out and not communicated to the site installation team responsible for writing the WPP. • TBS did not mention the criticality of the operation and its design. • Proposed that meetings to discuss high risk areas are undertaken at start up, monthly and weekly to identify these and other issues. People at that meeting must include the site installation team and designers. • High risk WPP’s should look different than run of the mill works so that they are easily identifiable by site who can then demand a meeting. • Any changes to the WPP should be communicated in detail to the site team- responsibility WPP owner."
Hub Days On Chorley the subcontractors and other stakeholders attended a Hub Day immediately prior to critical works. It was agreed that this focused minds and helped keep people safe. The day was delivered by a safety coach who was one of the men which reinforced and its credibility. The safety coaches attended at site during the blockade which it was agreed added value. • Prior to critical blockades or other key programme dates have a hub day say one week before • Have the safety bus and coaches visit regularly.
F001 – Sign off. Delay in formal acceptance of the F001 by the RAM lead to difficulties in developing the F003 design and also to procurement issue with the wider supply chain. Numerous requests for additional information distract the design team from concentrating on the detailed design. Work starts on site without AFC drawings which leads to the site team being apprehensive about early material procurement. The F001 was only signed off once construction had started. This can bring additional risk to delivery and procurement. It was agreed that the RAM should get involved as early as possible and be kept informed of the risks.
"Fatigue Management The new signing on and off mechanism was discussed at length. There were problems with it such as people being judged to be over hours who were not. Numerous anomalies have been identified. All these are being rectified, General feeling was that it could work when de[1]bugged. • Review shift patterns during blockades, 12 hours is not working. • Operatives to be briefed on the importance of using data scope for signing in and out on time."
"Project Integration including other sites, contractors and haulage. Project delivered alongside the larger Chorley Tunnel scheme. Inter industry integration meetings were held to keep everyone informed about the works. There were weekly integration meetings from the start that promoted inclusion and shared information. Unanimous opinion that this element worked well. Overall programme changed during the main blockade due to various issues and needed to be revised. The original date for the installation of the new structure was not achieved and the large 1000 tonne mobile crane needed to be delayed for 1 week which had large cost implications. Always consult as part of the inter industry review • All projects arrange Project Integration meetings, making sure that the right people attend to keep everyone informed. Works changed but still delivered on time so overall programme duration was robust. Identify the reasons why the programme had to be changed and feedback to the planning team for more accurate future programmes. The original programme was not adhered to and the site team were not ready for the original date for the new bridge installation, this was due to some inexperience from the site team on what items needed to be ready and on the installation of the temporary works for the suspension of the existing BT cables. This was compounded by some senior site team members being on AL on the lead up to the main structure installation."
"JMS store plant and materials on 3rd party land owners property without official permission leading to a large fine • Preconstruction team identified the approvals which would be required with the 3rd party land owners and completed all necessary agreements in advance of the works, this was briefed to the site manager, however the site manager then entered into a local agreement with the leaseholder to store plant and materials on a hard standing which was then challenged by the legal team of the actual land owner resulting in a fine to JMS"
The quality of the design submission was very good with very few technical queries being raised. Ensure JMS provide feedback to the designer about a good buildable design and continue to have buildability reviews during the design process to make the design more efficient.
Large cost saving of circa £400K made by suspending the BT fibre optic cables instead of having a two stage diversion . Service diversions were carried out for all stats onto a scaffold service bridge. BT wanted a very large sum of money to divert their fibre optic cables and a programme duration which was very long. JMS temporary works team design a cable suspension system which meant that the BT services could be suspended during the demolition and new bridge installation. This was not possible for the other stats authorities as they would not allow their services to be suspended.
"Natural stonework installation to the faces of the parapets was carried out faster than programmed and end product was of very good quality. The PCC copers were fabricated incorrectly with all of the dowels having to be removed and re[1]installed. Multiple concrete cube testing failures for in-situ concrete. Good quality of installed stonework by subcontractor. Installation was also delivered quicker than originally planned. PCC copers were fabricated incorrectly meaning they had to be reworked. This had programme and cost consequences. Off-site inspections of PCC units need to be more detailed and checked for this issue on future schemes, the fabricator (Shay Murtagh) was informed of the non-conformance and costs deducted from their account. Consider using different supplier for the smaller PCC elements such as copers. Several cube failures result in a request from NR to produce a report detailing any remedial measures required and explanations on why the failures have occurred. JMS CRE investigates and finds that the site team are not adhering to all of the quality procedures for concrete sampling and some of the site records are inconsistent. Designer asked to produce a report with JMS input which reassessed the elements of the concrete structure with low test results to confirm that they still satisfy the design requirements, all of this results in lots of time demands on the engineering team and damage to JMS reputation."
Hub Days The subcontractors and other stakeholders attended a Hub Day immediately prior to critical works. It was agreed that this focused minds and helped keep people safe. The day was delivered by a safety coach who was one of the men which reinforced and its credibility. The safety coaches attended at site during the blockade which it was agreed added value. • Prior to critical blockades or other key programme dates have a hub day say one week before • Have the safety bus and coaches visit regularly.
A number of weekend possessions had to be cancelled at the start of the shift due to incorrect paperwork on site. This led to inefficiency and abortive costs • Site manager to check and collate all of the paperwork required for the works in advance of the shift and cancel the shift if the paperwork is incomplete.
"Works completed 1 week ahead of time. Good Programme/Management of Statutory Authorities. Works carried out on time, progress on site was very good. Very good liaison with adjoining property owners, Eithiad campus. All Stats works in accordance with Target Programme Requirements, especially ENWL."
The demolition & reconstruction works were carried out on one core possession. A temp RRAP was established within the worksite which made the core possession works very accessible and reduced on time. Again filler beam installation was carried out in bulk and formwork pre-installed which reduced time on site and working from height.
" The design was generally positive, the details from the parapet to the beam was executed with high quality and specified standard All temp works was carried out inside and on time and within the clients time constraints. Specification was late in submission and lacking detail with regards to the reconstruction of the carriageway and footways. At design stage more information needs to be detailed with regards to the proposed reconstruction. No AFC drawing produced until requested by Site Team, this needs to be addressed at initial design stage."
"Original Design of Temporary Pedestrian/Service Bridge. All temporary works was carried out in time. Early liaison with the TW team with the crane position allowed third party land requirements. These was carried out early within the project. Due to the good working relationship with the landowner, no charges were submitted just to make good the area. Footbridge bridge –used only for services."
 Vastly experienced with regards to the demolition and reconstruction of the structure and road lift associated with the Electrification of the Bridges
 Quality ITP’s were kept up to date and complied.
" Existing Supply Chain. New Supply Chain Sub-Contractors. All lead in times were carried out in time and long lead items carried out in time. Waterseal, Corecut, Vertical Access, Ainscough & Huyton Asphalt vastly experienced with regards JMS requirements and methodology."
 Very well prepared and priced. Risk register was not raised at design stage.
" None raised, Health and safety file raised and accepted."
"Small site set up but suited the works, traffic management kept to a minimum."
" Very good works by ENWL, JMS health and safety officer praised the quality of their temporary works."
Good relationship with neighbours. Good relationship with NwR & Local Authorities. Very good relationship with Eithaid stadium campus and Murphy’s team. Good relationship with security team on site and the Eithaid stadium. Where it was possible the footways within the works were opened up for match days. The footways were kept open to the first last minute to reduce the impact on the public. Main road re-opened 1 week earlier and ahead of programme.
"Works completed 4 weeks ahead of programme, however this could have been up to 6 weeks earlier if original design was of a better standard. Good Programme/Management of Statutory Authorities. More liaison required during design and tender stage between designers, NwR, Local Authority and Project Team to ensure design is sufficiently detailed, compliant and proposed road reconstruction kept to absolute minimum. All Stats with exception of Vodafone undertook their works in accordance with Target Programme Requirements. However Vodafone came up trumps at the end to ensure the temporary scaffold was dismantled during the penultimate programmed T3 possession."
"Inadequate land agreements with regards to SW verge, during project had to obtain approval of Local Authority to access the area to undertake the works."
"Original Design of Road Lift. Specification. Original design of Southern Approaches. Surfacing Specification. Road Markings. Site team redesigned but both internal and external designers were reluctant to approve the design. Several months passed with site team pushing for acceptance, with reluctance designers gave agreement. Designers need to consider reducing the scope of works to absolute minimum in respect that the projects main aim is to increase headroom to the structure and not reconstruct the highway for the local authority. Specification was late in submission and lacking detail with regards to the reconstruction of the carriageway and footways. At design stage more information needs to be detailed with regards to the proposed reconstruction. Noncompliant design after numerous discussions between site team and designers a compliant design was achieved being SW- re-profiling of verge c/w VRS and SE – RC Wall c/w Wall muted section and driven section of VRS and local re-profiling of verge."
Original Design of Temporary Pedestrian/Service Bridge. Lift Plan. NwR require the Lift Plan to be issued with the associated WPP when initially submitted for their approval. Going forward no WPP’s will be approved without the associated Lift Plan attached.
JMS Site Team. Vastly experienced with regards to the demolition and reconstruction of the structure and road lift associated with the Electrification of the Bridges.
Long Lead in Materials Procured early stage. Contracts Manager procured all main precast elements of the new structure in good time to ensure logistics on site ahead of programmed installation dates.
"Existing Supply Chain. New Supply Chain Sub-Contract. Waterseal, Corecut, Vertical Access, Ainscough & Huyton Asphalt vastly experienced with regards JMS requirements and methodology. Johnny Edwards Paving & Dee Landscapes employed to undertake kerbing and soft landscaping works."
"Inadequate allowance for temporary pedestrian/service bridge, surfacing and road markings. Going forward need to have non subcontract work items broken down into labour, plant and materials to omit the requirement for the site team to have to back engineer to extrapolate this information Suggest a set up commercial meeting to discuss all allowances."
"QOB Nr8 item 5. QOB Nr9. QOB Nr 1 to 9 raised during the construction of the project. All but 2Nr Items closed out. QOB Nr 1 to 9 raised during the construction of the project. All but 2Nr Items closed out. Will be monitored during the 12 months maintenance period – hair line cracks in surface of precast concrete copings to Parapet, H4A & N2 walls."
Statutory Undertakers When placing sub-contract orders we need to request they supply a waste management plan and all necessary certification necessary to comply with the regulations.
"Good relationship with neighbours. Good relationship with NwR & Local Authorities. Pool Challenge competition with Finest Solutions Printers (£380 spent on Event including upgrading their pool table). Main road re-opened 4 weeks earlier and opening ceremony attended by NwR, the Mayor of Greater Manchester & Salford and Urban Vision. Cheque for £250 handed over during opening ceremony to ‘Peel Park Pink Picnic."
Demolition and reconstruction The demolition was carried out over two weekends. The first core possession was extremely successful with the demolition completed and cills units installed. This allowed to reduce night time working on the 2nd & 3rd core possessions.
"Surveying Site/office Setup, (Including Security) Track movement of roll pile Demolition. Piling works. Reduced nightime works. The site set up used was the empty warehouse unit adjacent the works which was rented out from the council. Thus providing welfare facilities, electric and gas. Also was very productive from a security point of view as all plant was locked in the warehouse at night. The project had some delay between the pile design and due to lack of communication between the pile designer our our designer. A working area was created in the 10ft area which was enclosed. Access was created from the scaffolding footbridge with access direct into the 10ft. This allowed works to be carried out during the day."
"The bridge was design and reconstructed to two span with a new simple supported single span flat deck superstructure to achieve normal clearance with full tolerance between rail and soffit. The design was generally positive, the details from the parapet to the beam was executed with high quality and specified standard. Installation of cable tray. Looking at putting a note in the AFC drawing explaining the design process. More emphasis on the third party involvement on carrying out design and possible continuity with more efficient and success rate. Poor attendance from NR s&t teams to remove cables from existing bridge or to identify the cables or the reinstallation at a later date."
"Permit to Load Suitability of temporary works. Network rail Failing to deal with street assets. Water main leakage . Cable tray not taken down by network rail, during which a discovery was made some of the cable were life. Crain pads were installed in the line of service diversion works, the superlift 100t tray was unloaded on the ground above the water main joint causing the water main to leak."
"Labour Staff Training Experience Competence. Communication. Subcontract labour was used to supplement JMS labour throughout the contract, joiners and brick layers were used although this work could probably have been incorporated into one of the subcontract packages and be less expensive in the long run. The Oldfield scheme run as a full time project making the communication between Client, JMS subcontractor and temporary workers very easy."
"Hire/Off Hire Maintenance Certification. Tractors, Dumpers, Toller. etc. The works area trackside was too small to allow large track to takeout the large pile of waste after demolition. All machinery used on site worked effectively and are the best recommended for the projects."
Material Requisition Store Requisition Storage Stock Control Waste Materials. Use of COSH Store. All materials required for the works were procured without any issues. Keep materials safe and protected from bad weather conditions. Good communication between the site team and the purchase department resulted in materials purchased timeously to meet the contract programme.
"Management/ Supervision Communication Competence & Experience One subcontractor KCOM did not meet the standards required. They held up the programme were found to be disruptive. These issues were raised early doors and were resolved on time Subcontractors generally regarded as effective in terms of work carried out on site, good working relationship. Generally Good working relationship between JMS and subcontractors. And cost less as training and certification has already been carried out on major subcontractors Staffs.Regular meeting Document /certificate Check."
"Documentation.No risk register incorporated at tender stage. Commercial to ensure electronic filing system is kept up to date; to include tenders, quotes, payments, FA’s etc. Project was assigned a document controller so filing, documentation and requisition were entirely populated."
"Non-Conformances Records. Handover. An audit from DNV was carried out on the scheme with results issued as excellent. Quality assurance certification approved. Subcontractor generally satisfactory. Subcontractors generally accessed as positive in terms of work carried out on site, good working relationship. Use of Class B material. H & S File was is been prepared for hand over to the client, it is scheduled to be submitted within the accepted timescales following completion of the project."
"Site Setup Traffic management Welfare Facilities. First Aid/ Emergency Station. Traffic Management. The client was happy with our site set-up, welfare facilities, including the site compound arrangements were well organised. No Accident on site through the duration of the project. A dedicated First Aider was assigned to check the emergency boxes and first aider on site weekly. Good communication with the council enabled our traffic management arrangements went without any Incidents or complaints, considering a lot of the work were traffic management was required."
"Environmental Incident. Noise Control. There were no waste management or environmental issues or incidents during the project. There were relatively few, if any, noise related issues highlighted by neighbours during the project."
"Mobilisation Mobilisation to site in a sensitive area, a clear demobilisation sequence had been established and approved. it was clear that all temporary works would be completed in time for demolition possessions without causing delay on site."
"Site / office Setup Security / Surveying Setting out Construction method, Inspections Commissioning Testing Work Package Plan was visited and late discovery of asbestos Sheet on the underside of the bridge deck “between the beams” could have delay the project, JMS has agreed that before any demolition of further structures was carried out a comprehensive survey including the underside on any bridge over 60years old a investigation must be carried out to search for asbestos related materials. Installation was successful and efficient. Promote the use of long individual deck beams placed in groups of four and bolted together using H beams for similar bridge project and throughout JMS."
"Designer Experience Design Change, Design Review, Drawing Control Management of Subcontract Designers (Including Communication) Management of Internal Designer. The bridge was removed and replaced with a two span structure to achieve 4700mm. Span one was 17m long and the second was a 15m long span with large concrete parapets, each span on span 11 was individually designed and installed with tremendous success. Positiv e Changes were made to the water main."
"Line Blockage. Labour. The parapet unit was designed in a slightly curve shape which made it a little difficult to install, JMS will need to take into account essentials services to the design .Topographic survey to confirm cut off level and service on drawings not as being discovered during construction. Resulting in delays on site. During the Christmas blockade a engineering Train went through the worksite on the down main when it was supposed to be on the up main, this resulted in the train hitting our for work rebar and damaged a side light on the front of the train."
"Staff. Competence. Subcontract labour was used to supplement JMS labour towards the end of the project, particularly painters and Joiners, although this work should have been added to the original subcontract package and should have cost less to complete the contract. The Site Manager, Project Manager and Site. Foreman were all qualified and fully competent to hand the projects from start to finish. e Service of Cleaner Engaged Rather than one of the staff operatives cleaning the canteen and offices a professional cleaning firm was introduced and this ensured the site canteen and offices were at a great standard at all times."
Hire/ Off Hire Maintenance / certification. All Plants and Equipment requirement were coordinated well and of satisfactory standard.
"Tractors/ Dumpers/Rollers Lead Time Requisition Incoming Inspection Store control. All Materials required for the works were procured without any issues. Storage Storage Stock Control. Good communication between the site team, document controller and the buying department resulted in material purchased timelessly to meet the contract programme. Material transported to site only as required, resulting in no delays."
Purchasing Lead times Management / Supervisor (Including Communication) Competence & Experience. Generally JMS engaged tested and trusted subcontractors in all its major projects and this scheme was not an exception.
"Tender/ Estimate understanding of contract / client requirements administration of contract, change control (Including Time bar) communication (Including document control, progress meetings) Final Account."
"Non-Conformances, CARs Records / Handover. Reports of manhole lid had sank slightly that was rectified JMS received queries about safety barriers. Good Quality of installing Packs 4 x 17m long deck beams with tremendous success and the installation was also delivered faster than originally planned."
"Site Setup Traffic Management Welfare facilities. Incidents. The process of ordering site offices and installation was not delivered to the best standard, JMS informed the transport about it and changes were made. The discovery of Asbestos and the way it was handled, Material waste was left on site for too long."
"Waste Management. Ecology. Traffic management provided was very effective throughout the project period without any major issues or road incident. There were no major waste management or environmental issues during this project. The rail bridge corridor was a potential habitat for reptiles, JMS Provide all personnel working in the scheme with full briefing with respect to the potential presence of great crested newts along the railway corridor and made aware of the action to be taken if a reptile is found."
" For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re[1]occurrence. Design was changed from an anchor solution to a lightweight material fill in order to ensure project finish date was met and it will be as profitable solution as possible. This design solution reduced the amount of possession working."
" Very late submission of AFC drawings. In this case we were actually on site before designers have even found suitable design solution, which would be acceptable from commercial and technical point of view."
 Temporary works regarding access staircase and corner towers quite quickly addressed and sorted out.
There should be more people trained as a first aiders on site.
" Hire department IT systems not working to desired standards, few items although off hired/transferred to other jobs still showing on weekly live hire sheets. When pointed out to hire desk, I was informed that system will not allow to amend for unknown reason. All internal plant delivered to site in good order, no issues or defects Severe problems with Apogee Corp. – printer ordered has been delivered over a month after, following quite a few phone calls, making working on site close to impossible."
 Weekly order number (TP/Keyline) for small/minor orders is a great idea implemented over few last jobs. Very handy option in critical situations.
" United Utilities did not know about existence of their water main in the Soho Street bridge deck. Pipe has been found by JMS just in time to avoid potentially large costs, if not dealt with on time. There was a danger of postponing Core Possession, if water main is not capped off or diverted before."
" Problems with reinstating by Utility companies subcontractors (BT, ENW, Vodafone, Virgin, National Grid, Water, etc.). Tarmac reinstated has collapsed after few weeks and added additional costs for JMS to fix."
 Facilities All good considering size of the job.
 Environmental department very helpful with solving day to day problems and general advice.
"Project Integration including other sites, contractors and haulage. Project delivered alongside the larger Chorley Tunnel scheme. Inter industry integration meetings were held to keep everyone informed about the works. There were weekly integration meetings from the start that promoted inclusion and shared information. Unanimous opinion that this element worked well. Overall programme changed during the main blockade due to various issues and needed to be revised. Always consult as part of the inter industry review · All projects arrange Project Integration meetings, making sure that the right people attend to keep everyone informed. · Works changed but still delivered on time so overall programme duration was robust. Identify the reasons why the programme had to be changed and feedback to the planning team for more accurate future programmes."
Preconstruction team identified the approvals which would be required with the Environment Agency and 3rd party land owners and completed all necessary agreements in advance of the works  Continue to successfully identify advance long lead in agreements which will be necessary with 3rd parties and get them in place early on in the life of the project
A number if site issues concerning the design were highlighted by the site team. 1. The designer originally specified 40N strength foam concrete which is not possible. The lightweight concrete infill material was subsequently changed from 40N to 10N and then to 5N which raised a lack of confidence in the design by the NR DPE. This was compounded by cube failures during the onsite. 2. The joint between the FRP trough and the existing construction failed leading to water leaking down the embankment and onto the track. · Ensure JMS provide feedback to the designer about what lightweight concrete can be procured for the works and its limitations. Designer to specify what is practical. · The overall design solution of the FRP trough was good although the end joints failed and started leaking during colder temperatures when the structure contracted. If this design solution is to be used in the future more attention should be spent on the end joints from FRP to existing construction. A more robust joint detail which can cope with the movement of the FRP will need to be specified on future schemes.
Site was located in an area off difficult access so the FRP troughs were designed in 3 pieces and planned for installation using a road rail 40tonne crane. Site requirement for in-situ joints for the FRP trough required weather proofing and encapsulation. This was not effectively communicated to the wider site team and as such no allowance was made in the programme for scaffold and encapsulation. Installation was successful and efficient. Promote the use of Road rail cranes for similar schemes within other JMS delivery streams. There is a possibility to design future bridge installations around the lifting capacity of this plant. Specific requirements for the supply chain need to be effectively communicated to the planner and site team so they can be accommodated and priced.
Natural stonework installation to the faces of the foam concrete was carried out faster than programmed and end product was of very good quality .· Good quality of installed stonework by TA Law subcontractor. Installation was also delivered quicker than originally planned.
FRP trough was procured from a supplier in Holland which had not previously been used by JMS. Raising and signing off of the materials delivery order was problematic and protracted due to the lack of knowledge within JMS of the supplier. Some of the conditions stipulated by the supplier put JMS at risk as the material was not insured during transit. The delay in JMS making a payment to the supplier delayed delivery to site and pushed back the site installation as they would not release the material until payment was made. Where possible try to procure from the current pool of JMS suppliers based in this country as inspections of the manufacture were expensive due to travel arrangements and different contract conditions with some European suppliers placed JMS at risk.
Hub Days The subcontractors and other stakeholders attended a Hub Day immediately prior to critical works. It was agreed that this focused minds and helped keep people safe. The day was delivered by a safety coach who was one of the men which reinforced and its credibility. The safety coaches attended at site during the blockade which it was agreed added value. · Prior to critical blockades or other key programme dates have a hub day say one week before · Have the safety bus and coaches visit regularly.
Scheme was originally set up with Mark Simpson as senior site manager looking after Harpers lane and River Chor assisted with two site foremen. The pace of the works was such that Mark could not oversee both projects and additional site management team needed to be drafted in to help. As this was unplanned the team at river Chor changed various times due to staff availability and summer holiday cover. This led to inefficiency and inconsistency on site. · Senior management team to allocate a suitably sized site team for future schemes.
A number of weekend possessions had to be cancelled at the start of the shift due to incorrect paperwork on site. This led to inefficiency and abortive costs  Site manager to check and collate all of the paperwork required for the works in advance of the shift and cancel the shift if the paperwork is incomplete
Lack of Technical expertise in Signaling and Telecoms. Murphy were asked to carry out signaling works as part of an additional scope request. NWR were originally intended to do this work but had no resources available. Started on site six weeks ahead of schedule and without a contract. At a critical 29-hour possession the bulk of allocated resource was taken away and given to Chorley leaving this job light. Before undertaking any works that are outside of our skillsets assess the risk and value to our company. Agree whether we should proceed or not with senior management. • Appoint a competent third party to oversee the works we do not have any experience in. In this case the subcontractor took advantage of our ignorance. Resource manager now in place • Requirements were known several months out. Better planning of resources needed and farther out. • Some float in resource pool required even if by subcontracting elements out. • Once allocated resources should not be moved at the last minute or at all without the Project Manager approval and back up being made available.
"The Programme was never a true reflection and could not keep up with the changes. In particular things went off course when the 5 week delay was encountered for the uncharted services, Lessons. • Projects of this nature require more senior management in this case a dedicated Project Manager who could have looked at all the scope growth, programme and cost implications. A full time PM and QS would have paid for themselves here. • Planning resource was insufficient, he had too many Projects to cover so did not pick up all the changes or their implications. • Team should have stopped when the 5 week delay was incurred and challenged the NWR programme as unachievable at that stage. This should have been formally communicated in writing. There is nothing wrong with challenging end dates after scope growth. • When programming be more realistic about what is achievable by us and the other parties. • We started work on draft designs without instruction. Make sure we do not proceed without formal instruction in writing. Once the Construction drawings are issued track, and value changes both cost and time • A finishing team would have been useful."
"Contract set up -. Babcocks Pway, NWR Design, we were asked to use Linbrooke for signalling. Murphy were PC but had no Contractual relationship with Babcock who were arrogant and uncooperative when brought to task about anything. Client issues. The client was not collaborative nor did he work to the spirit or letter of the Contract. Even EWN and letters were ignored. The team were reluctant to make any waves as CP5 was on the horizon. Also the Client had internal issues that restricted his budget. Agree with NWR at the outset that Murphy safety culture will not be compromised or we will stop work. Include in inductions. • Do not be afraid to stop the other Contractors or NWR even if we are on a tight schedule. Murphy senior management will back any stopping of unsafe work. • Make it clear in the induction what we expect and that we will not tolerate unsafe practices, explain the consequences. In these cases insist that PMI’s are issued for any changes. • Be more diligent with change notices, TQ’s and letters of confirmation. Use the contract, • In these cases of non -cooperation escalate to senior management early so that they can speak to higher powers within the NWR organisation • Never lose sight of the fact that the project must make money and changes have to be paid for."
Loss reduced to 150k The job was subject to repetitive scope growth for several reasons. Scope definition was also poor having a knock on effect to the pricing in some cases out by more than 100%. This meant we were at risk because the client was not responding to EWN or issuing PMI’s. He paid us what he had rather than what was due. Lessons • Confirm that NWR have the necessary funds in place before we do any work. If not get commitment to pay in writing before we start. • Do not sign the contract without confirmed volumes and levels of contamination or some way of accounting for them agreed by the Project team again in writing. • Put more emphasis and effort into the risk register and its costings.
"Client had several staff changes who were not up to speed. Lessons • Insist on a joint hand over meeting to review agreements in place and bring new players up to speed. • At the start up meeting agree who will, be client’s representative or signatory to any documents particularly the snagging and inspections. If that individual leaves then make sure the list is updated. This avoids having numerous iterations particularly of snagging and the Hand over package. • One agreed snag list."
No accidents or incidents particularly environmental and cable strikes. There were uncharted services in the old sidings. Slow worm colony in the spoil heap all unknown at contract agreement. • Make sure trial holes and several of them are done at the earliest even if time is short. Time invested in fully charting unknown cables/services at the project outset is time well spent. • When uncharted services are located early warn immediately in this case caused a 5 week delay. • Research environmental information and carry out early surveys. Removal of the slow worm population caused extensive delay that could have been avoided.
Can do attitude. We were keen to get the job done and did everything to help the client achieve his goals. Unfortunately it meant that our own goals and aspirations of a successful outcome were not met we lost money. • We will always deliver but not at any cost we must be paid for what we do. In cases such as Bromsgrove we must use the contract. • This was unfamiliar work with continuous scope expansion and multi interface as such high risk to us. Any additional scope must be by signed PMI with cost and programme implications before it is undertaken. • In high risk cases such as this more and experienced commercial resources required.
Seen as a great opportunity for us to show we can deliver the more complex Projects and higher value. This clouded our vision of the risk Lessons • Make sure everyone understands the Contract particularly the risks and how change is managed. • We learned about the timescale requirements of the other trades and contractors. • Make sure that Murphy Senior Management buy into any new business stream activities. • Make sure we have appropriate technical expertise available to manage any new ventures. • We gained valuable experience of signalling that could be used in future.
"4 Contractors had already rejected this scheme. Murphy took the risk with this project when packaged with three other jobs. a) The sequencing of the works, duration of the activities did not reflect the reality. b) Resource profiling was inaccurate c) Constructability was not considered in enough detail early enough. d) Originally the works were not in possession but the proposed machine did not have enough power at the required reach so possessions were required. e) No temporary works coordinator. Even though ’We Can Do’ this type of scheme we must consider all the risk. It must be shown that the project can be profitable and the design is viable before we sign any contract. ) Provision must be made in the contract to re-price and programme the works once the full extent of the scope is fully defined. b) Once the project is repriced and programmed the whole team must control to that price and be bought into it"
TQ’S were not answered. An example being TQ1 submitted to Network Rail March no reply until October. Murphy did not manage the process well and should have made sure that they were resolved or escalated earlier. a) D. In future the contractual date for answering will be included on the TQ. We will then contact the client just prior to the expiry of the allotted time saying after that date we will proceed deeming it approved. It must be clear that the lead Engineer owns the technical whilst the PM will make any decision in which way to proceed on failure to respond or otherwise. a) Assess the scope and sometimes say no until the scope is adequately defined. b) Try not to change key members of the team at critical times c) Become involved earlier with NR to make sure that all necessary survey work is completed and site condition are known and considered.
"Project is forecasted to lose over 100k The original scope, estimate and design does not reflect what was actually built. Although NR were informed of Change they ignored us. Problems were exacerbated by team changes at critical times. Appeasing NR Commercially a) We took the job at a loss by trying to find false economies that weren’t there b) Caveats on our contract were in some cases unrealistic c) Murphy changed methodologies to fall in line with NR authority requirements, we knew they were unachievable. d) I. P appeared to ignore (or not understand) the change register even though it was submitted every month a) We must improve our project management of scope change. Issues should be escalated when correspondence or requests for change are completely ignored. b) Construction team have to be involved earlier on this type of scheme so that they are bought into the solution, programme and estimate. Set up monthly commercial meeting at which the change register must be agreed and finalised. Any items that are not resolved after two moths escalate until they are."
"Team worked together well a) Worked together to make sure that the best man for the job was on any task b) Even though there was constant change in design, programme, NR constant requests morale remained high c) Team quickly resolved any contentious issues together. Lesson Try to keep consistency in teams to build the relationships and trust so that they are strong enough to be honest with each other."
Culture Development Programme engaged well. a) Everyone was engaged and involved in how the job should be built b) Everyone took pride and ownership in the scheme. c) From the worksite to the messing facility was a one mile round trip yet people just got on with it and morale was high. Lessons a) Involve the work force at design development stage ask them how they would do this task. b) Get the coaches and HS involved day one. c) Brief ALL the team before and throughout the project keep them informed.
"Building Good Relationships with 3rd Parties a) There were some difficult landowners to deal with – Murphy worked with them built the trust and had a great relationship in the end. b) Land Access- Most of the licences were last minute by NR this meant that the locals lost confidence and trust in them. Something Murphy turned around. c) UU had already stated that they would use statutory powers for access which meant NR suffered as the locals tried to hit them for additional monies. Lesson Plan the stakeholder management. Meet face to face, tell people we are coming early, keep them informed. Try to have one point of contact with a consistent message."
 The works were fast tracked to enable the footbridge to be erected in financial year ending March 2014. The Initial enquiry from Network Rail was received during late December 2013. All parties were aware of the requirement of mutual collaboration to achieve the tight timescales.
 A contractor was already working on site for a third party and by negotiation JMS took over the hire of the existing site welfare cabin and store for the whole of the bridge works contract period.The setting out of the new structure was critical with foundation bolt clusters cast in each pile cap. The tolerance allowable was minimal. All foundations were double checked prior too and after casting and were and found to be correct. Piles were integrity tested after being cropped to the required reduced level. All piles were found to be compliant.
 The design was part of the clients brief and responsibility with the exception being the design of the insitu piles. This was carried out by the subcontract piling contractor – Keller Geotechnic. JMS reviewed the pile cap design produced by the client (based on a standard detail) and requested that the designers redesign the pile caps for ease of construction that would eliminate the need for a temporary works design for the ground support. The designers duly obliged and produced a more cost effective detail which also saved valuable construction time.  The manufacture of the footbridge was carried out in Northern Ireland by McGrath Engineering. The PO for which was supplied by the client but JMS were responsible for carrying out quality inspections.
"Temporary works included the construction of a piling platform, formwork design for the pilecaps and the 200tonne crane outrigger berthing positions. All TWD items were designed in house by our Temporary Works Engineers."
 The works were carried out by a very small JMS team headed by Darren Arno (Site Manager). The site engineering was carried out by Michal Zajac.
 Several excavators were hired in which had slew restrictors built in to accommodate the requirements of ALO working which is closely monitored by NWR.
 Lead in times were very tight but were achievable. Site storage on site was very limited but well managed by the site team No significant material wastage was encountered.
" Due to the tight lead in times, a piling contractor was engaged very early in the process. Although this was necessary it did leave the door open to the sub contractor to optimise his return. The costs of which were picked up by the client Other subcontract works included tree felling, concrete testing, bridge installation, ground testing, fencing and steel fixing. All of which were successfully carried out."
 The tender was compiled by M Carter who also carried out the QS duties on the contract. Administration of the contract was carried out diligently with the client supplying early PO’s to enable early engagement. Progress of the contract was monitored very closely with weekly telephone conference calls lasting approx one hour each time. These were very time effective and productive. The FA is yet to be agreed but no problems are envisaged.
 Quality checks on the fabrication and painting of the new footbridge were carried out by JMS’s inspector – no issues were reported. Integrity testing was carried out to the piles – no issues reported. Concrete strength testing was carried out to the insitu cast pile caps – no issues reported.
Welfare facilities were taken over as described above. Assess traffic used the existing NWR access Roadway.
" No Environmental Incidents or Accidents There were several trees cut down to facilitate crane movements, these trees were felled in February ahead of the bird nesting season."
Difficulties were experienced with regard to JMS personnel using the pedestrian crossing to access each side of the track. NWR standards required that the crossing would need its risk assessment to be re-evaluated to allow for the increased use. This took several weeks. JMS had to supply additional safety critical personnel at times to comply whilst waiting for NWR to produce a revised Risk Assessment.
Programme had a two week node contingency built-in from the critical path that was needed due to sourcing the correct P&T form JMS internal hire Programme to be checked with site team prior to project implementation.
"CAD files and setting out points handed over by client. JMS site engineer carried out a survey of existing canopy, so that new canopy extension mirrors existing line & level Check CAD files and setting out information prior to starting project, rather than doing it after implementation of works."
"Network Rail BGD internal design. Design had a mechanical fix for the ‘I’ Beam canopy connection to existing masonry wall, which did not work very well due to existing brickwork being made from Frog Bricks and tending to shatter will drilling through for a good connection. All designs were issued/signed off prior to project implementation, with no TQ’s being sought. Ensure future works are checked via a structural survey for buildability and any alterations made in adequate time, which will help eliminate pressures in terms of time constraints for the site team. On this occasion JMS removed old frog bricks replaced with engineering brick and filled cavity with 40N concrete."
All trades and competencies were satisfactory. Continue to update staff training where required.
JMS P&T department cross[1]hired a RRV which did not have the capacity to do on[1]track heavy lifting with cant of track Survey track prior to ordering RRV’s to ensure the correct plant is available to achieve what is required during core possession working.
"Red radial engineering brick was left slightly late to order and source. Site team need to identify long lead-in items at the earliest opportunity, thus avoiding possible project delays."
"Harrison Engineering Ltd sent out an item of steel which had been painted within factory conditions, which did not meet the expected standard/finish JMS Clerk of works to carry out an inspection steel work repairs and associated paints works, prior to subcontractor sending to site, which may eliminate the need to rub down and repaint on site. Other than this minor issue, Harrison Engineering Ltd helped deliver the project on time and without incident."
The contract was delivered on time and within budget constraints Both Network Rail & J Murphy & Sons split the profit made on this particular project.
"H&S File was handed over to Network Rail within 1 week of project competition Continue to ensure subcontractors build up their H&S file as the project progress, thus ensuring a smooth handover to the client."
"Site set-up within Mersey Rail station only achieved the bare minimum site set-up, due to limited space available in Aigburth Station car park .Agree a site set-up size and location with all parties prior to project implementation."
No waste management issues .Nothing to suggest.
"Programme over ran a couple of weeks due to being more labour intensive than originally planned, due design changes, restrictive access and compound issues with Arriva Trains Wales .Agree site set-up and access prior to formulating the programme of works."
"High street environment working, with site engineer setting out works from control points issued from Capita Symonds. JMS were instructed by NR to use both Cycle Works Ltd and Capita Symonds. `None."
"It transpired that Cycle Works Ltd and Capita Symonds had altered the original base support of the Josta 2 Tier canopies to quite a substantial concrete base, without consulting JMS before issuing final designs. Original design for Area 5 had the glazed barrier concrete plinth running directly through existing ECO drains. Check AFC drawings for buildability before mobilising on site and agree changes before signing off AFC drawings."
All trades and competencies were satisfactory Continue to update staff training where required
No issues with P&T equipment Survey track prior to ordering RRV’s to ensure the correct plant is available to achieve what is required during core possession working.
"Concrete for base supports had to be manually wheeled from wagons to site of works, which amounted to hundreds of meters .Close station access at night when trains stop running and use mechanical methods i.e. small dumpers etc."
Cycle Works Ltd Seagle Direct Ltd .None.
"JMS had requested change controls to increase budget costs, as the designs had been changed by Capita Symonds, which meant more an extension of programme with extra resources. Network Rail & J Murphy & Sons agree change request designs prior to starting works."
"Network Rail only requested an O&M manual and not a full H&S handover file. Continue to ensure the build-up of H&S file as the project progress, thus ensuring a smooth handover to the client."
"Very poor welfare arrange s on site, due to Arrive Trains Wales not allowing JMS ample space to set-up an adequate site welfare/compound .Agree a site set-up size and location with all parties prior to project implementation."
"JMS had to pay standing costs for waste removal, due to not have ample space available to have a general waste skip on site. Agree a site set-up size and location with all parties prior to project implementation."
Weekly Preparation Meetings Allowed the team to discuss and resolve any issues collaboratively. It focused all the team on resource planning. Key resources were kept informed and available at the right time. Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined. A big positive was that all meetings were on site. 5 minute stand downs were used to focus on the way any task was being undertaken ‘was there a better way’. Pre- construction and planning The team showed great commitment to the in detail planning of the core possessions in a collaborative manner. Valuable de risking was achieved by giving detailed consideration to carrying out any upfront work we could prior to the blockade. Buildability reviews were carried out and seen as a must have by the Project Team. Lesson; Is that all projects should do this in some way. It is important that the wider Project are involved. Develop the plan in a structured manner to include all the Stakeholders. Agree the plan with all parties then stick to it. essons; 1. Formulate the hour by hour plan and define the owners line by line. 2. Design process must include buildability reviews. 3. QRSA should go thru buildability in more detail.
"Pre – erection/trial assembly. Beams were trial erected in Ireland. Some good and bad issues with this. Great opportunity to identify issues early and rectify. Estimated that ironing out the problems saved a possession. Downside was it was not seen as high priority by the team. The methodology and specification for the requirements of the trial were not fully agreed and defined. The attending team did not fully understand the requirement when attending the trial. Lessons 1. Develop a specification, methodology and set of check sheets to be issued as part of the subcontract and owned by Engineering. 2. Make sure that all off site manufacture has a trial erection and pre-ship testing regime issued with the tender."
"Design brief did not reflect the constructability or site requirement/temporary works. The Quality of design brief should have been better. Changing staff caused issues/planning resource. The Design was on the shelf not reviewed late submission to NR lost valuable time. Tolerance standard design, tolerances too tight Designer/Murphy felt tolerances were adequate. Quality control being manufacture fell down in some areas. The interface between the Pway and civils was not detailed enough. Required more detailed checks between all parties relating to Pway. The temporary works design brief did not adequately reflect all of the constructability temporary works requirements, which could be improved in future. Changing staff within the Murphy design management team and the associated lack of continuity through the project resulted in a number of issues and delays during the design phase. Once of these was that there was a delay between receipt of the Permanent works design and its subsequent onward submission to Network Rail. This resulted in an overall delay to the design approval, which could have been mitigated to some degree. The installation tolerance (specifically related to the location of bridge bearings onto cill units) was specified in accordance to the relevant NR standard design drawings. Hindsight showed that this should be improved on future projects. It is noted that during the review of the design this issue was discussed and at that time the Designer/Murphy felt that the tolerances were adequate. Issues were highlighted regarding the Quality control (during manufacture) of the precast concrete cill units. Specifically a number of dimensional errors were made, which were not identified until the units arrived on site. These errors resulted in reduced tolerances for installation of the bearings onto the cill units, and are therefore closely related to the design tolerance provision described above. No P-way design was included with the ITT. An assumption was made at tender stage that the alignment design of the tracks would be straight forward and that tie in positions would be close to the bridge. In addition, a number of assumptions related to vertical alignment were made in the development of the bridge scheme, which resulted in difficulties in obtaining technical approval of the PWay Form A. BY the time these issues were resolved the project programme dictated that a number of compromises were necessary with respect to the bridge. Track design should be issued with tender Detail plan the design review process manage it and meet regularly from the start of the project"
"There was a great team ethic which was thought to come from the team being together and knowing each other well. No us and them everyone was approachable and listened. Network rail were very supportive and really motivated the teams by encouraging and engaging with the workforce. 1. Not many P Way contractors out there 2. Decided to micro manage Stobarts – good idea/result 3. Re-instatement 4. Stobart used agency Ops not competent/no experience 5. Not motivated 6. People on zero hour contract 7. Didn’t adapt to the programme changes 8. Given drainage and Civil. In future just use for P way. Management Changes 1. Site agent changed after a few weeks 2. No commercial relationship staff, Changing every 4-6 weeks, continuity required. 3. Some roles and responsibilities not clear 4. Loss of momentum causes issues 5. CEM changed caused some delay/ learning curve. Availability of some information amalgamated with the above caused unnecessary problems and learning curves. Specify to the supply chain exactly what we expect particularly work ethic and culture. Make sure competencies are submitted with tender. Emphasise no subcontracting without written permission from the Project Manager."
"Pre cast concrete quality 1. Inspections must be by a competent person in that discipline 2. Poor Finish due to rushing 2 and half weeks to cast 3. Design management across the project caused us programme issues. 4. More attention to the planning or pre-construction phase. Pre – erection/trial assembly. The bridge deck and cill arrangement were trial erected at the steelwork fabrication yard. However, a number of issues were noted that should be improved for future projects. It is noted that the value of the trial erection was proven and negated installation issues from arising during the core possession. Where component fit and erection methodology are considered critical then trial erections should be undertaken on future projects. Dimensional checks on key components should be made and verified prior to the trial erection. • Appropriate materials should be provided (sand, shims etc.) such that site conditions can be replicated correctly. This should be provide in a specification to the steelwork fabricator in advance to avoid delays during the trial erection. • Adequate space should be made at the fabricators site to enable the trial Erection to take place. • The trial erections should be planned appropriately, and detailed in a WPP or similar such that those involved understand the requirements in advance. • The trial erections should be undertaken by the team who will install the bridge on site rather than by the steelwork fabricator in advance of the site team arriving at the fabricators premises. esson 1. Supplier should specify to us their pre-cast & manufacturing test regime. 2. A blank drawing of the precast drawing should be filled in by the Supplier at his precast inspection to show actual dimensions before the pour rather than rely on design drawings. The supplier should specify to us their pre-cast & manufacturing test regime which must be reviewed and accepted by Murphy. Adherence to this procedure must be audited during the quality checks undertaken by Murphy’s representative at the manufacturing site. Dimensional checks of the units should be undertaken at key stages of their manufacture. Measured dimensions should be marked on drawings for direct comparison with design values such that immediate validation and subsequent auditing can be undertaken to ensure accuracy. Simple tick boxes stating that checks have been undertaken are not considered sufficiently robust. Dimensions MUST be recorded and verified."
1. Engaged with the locals face to face to explain what we are doing. 2. Local Councillor took old parapets to use as monument. 3. Plaque on bridge to commemorate the original builders. 4. Involved all the locals/stakeholders 5. No complaints 6. Went to schools.  1. Try to involve the local community as early as we can. Keep them informed.
"Programme was seen as being very tight by the site delivery team with little or no original input from the site manager and site delivery team. Design programme was much longer than originally planned. Overall design management by Murphy was seen to be poor and this was a result of the difficulties in satisfying the requirements of the client. Network Rail insisted on one single design submission combining the responsibilities of the three design parties – Mott MacDonald (overall design), Structural fabrications (structural connections) and Pennine (pile design). Mott MacDonald were not in a position to develop and complete the F003 submission as they needed input from the Structural Steel Fabricator and JMS took longer than anticipated to procure this element of the works. The delay in completing the design had an impact on the site delivery team and the original planned efficiencies of installing all downspouts and conduit routes off site in factory conditions had to be aborted as programme pressures dictated that the structure installation had to be done as soon as possible. Where possible include the allocated site manager on the development of the site delivery programmes. Allocate a nominated Design Manager to coordinate Murphy buildability reviews of the design as it develops and supervises and has a direct influence on the design programme."
"Piling records which were recorded during the first attempt at piling did not contain sufficient level of detail – Once piling started on site it became increasingly evident that the design solution could not be installed due to the existing ground conditions. Review by the CRE and designer of all the information available including the piling records concluded that not enough detailed information was being recorded during piling. The piling record forms were subsequently revised to capture more information as recommended by the design team. During the initial GI/SI no member of the design team was on site to witness the investigation works, an opportunity was missed to identify that the ground conditions were very different to those expected – the design team agreed that for all future works it would be beneficial for a representative from the design team to be on site to be able to react to situations where sampling is not as expected and reassess the investigation requirements. The physical working space negotiated with the TOC and the local authority inside and outside the station for storage of plant and materials was small and seen as a big challenge. This made delivery of the works difficult. Return visit once the works were complete highlights that the local authority have contracted another company to carry out road works on the station approaches and they have been allocated much more working and storage space. The original plan for accessing plant and major materials to the platform furthest from the road was to use a crane during night time possessions. The site team come up with a better idea and liaised with the local authority to close some pedestrian footpaths which meant that plant and materials could be driven around the station to the furthest platform. This made the works much easier and reduced the amount of night time working. The environmental control measures to limit and damage by using this route were robust and adhered to on site well. Engineering control was well established and maintained. Holding down bolts for one element of the structure were incorrectly set out – orientation of the bolts was incorrect. This was not identified until installation of the structure was attempted and resulted in a section of the structure not being able to be installed and an aborted visit for the crane. Re work to the bolt cluster was necessary. Good collaboration and positive attitude demonstrated by the whole site team – Network rail, Murphy site team, Butler and Young to commission and accept the lifts into operational use by the agreed programme completion date of the 18th December. Pedestrian control measures for the general public using and accessing the station seen as very good – no incidents during the 12 months that the team were on site. Good relationship developed with the Network Rail and TPE staff working on the station – site team make effort to keep the station staff up to date with the construction progress. Recommend that more detailed information is included in the future piling record sheets by passing this revised format to our Quality Manager for distribution and use throughout the business. Highlight the benefits of how capturing more information during piling has helped to identify and solve issues during pile installation. Recommend that for future schemes the Design team should allocate a representative to be onsite (full time or visiting) during the GI phase of the works. Recommend that the preconstruction team liaise with the site delivery Project Manager and pursue compound space sufficient for the project needs without undue compromise. Promote the input of site managers and foremen when planning access strategy for the work so that the most practical solution can be developed first time. Continue to reinforce within the wider Murphy team the importance of establishing enough robust engineering controls and the benefits associated with this. Setting out of bolts to be checked on pre pour checks and then again once concrete has been completed to make sure that it is correct. Promote the benefits of fostering a good and open working relationship with our client - in this case our policy of keeping all parties involved in the construction process, Network Rail and Butler and Young were happy to work together with Murphy to open the lifts up to the public use to a much condensed programme as they were aware of the issues, and had seen the effort the site team had made to deliver the scheme. issue seriously and promote similar controls on other sites. Promote the benefits of involving the stakeholders in progress updates and the positive effect of them being aware of the ongoing works."
"Design responsibilities and liabilities remained unclear throughout the design of the project. Mott MacDonald were appointed as main designers with responsibility for the design with the exception of the pile design and the design of the structural steel connections, this was procured through the piling subcontractor Pennine and the Structural Steel subcontractor Structural Fabrications. At the time it was envisaged that the involvement of supply chain designers would lead to a more efficient design but Network Rail insisted on a single F003 submission with Mott MacDonald retaining the liability for all of the design. This resulted in a much protracted design programme as all design work done by Pennine and Structural Fabrications needed to be reviewed and checked by Mott MacDonald effectively duplicating design work. This also led to more delays as Structural Fabrications were reticent to release the calculations for their design elements due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Although this design arrangement was originally agreed with the best intentions, it was generally agreed that it would be done differently in the future with the main designer retaining the responsibility for the structural steel connections and possibly for the pile design. Any proposed changes by the supply chain could then be controlled through the TQ process. Insufficient site Investigation carried out prior to starting on site – The foundation design was based on desktop studies and one 8m deep window sample. The design solution was 19 micro piles 323mm diameter 15 to 18m deep. Although this lack of suitable information was highlighted by the pile designer and installer in their tender submissions to Murphy, the warning was not heeded as no cost had been allocated in the tender to carry out more robust GI. Pennine as the pile designer felt uncomfortable in adopting a more rigid stance with their client Murphy on the need for more comprehensive GI due to the cost implications to the project as a whole. The original pile design could not be installed which resulted in a stop to the works on site, a review of the information available and the agreement from all parties that more GI needed to be carried out and the pile design altered to suit the additional GI information. The programme delay and commercial implications were considerable. When works on site came to a stop due to the ground conditions, a joint forum/workshop was held between the client, all design parties and the site team to discuss and agree a new strategy to design and install the foundations. It was accepted that this was arranged very quickly and conducted in a very positive and collaborative manner with the sole focus being in solving the issues and agreeing the best possible solution with no recriminations. Poor design detailing of downpipes and conduit routes makes site installation unnecessarily difficult. Joint site visits with members of the design team took place to identify areas of poor or insufficient detailing. These were carried out in a very positive and collaborative manner and were seen to be a good idea to improve the designer’s exposure to site issues for detailing on future schemes. The Technical Query process was adhered to and managed well by the CRE and was seen as an efficient way of implementing change control. The design for the fabricated steel elements for the stairs and landings were not very practical given the support legs came attached to the main body of the stairs / landings. This resulted in difficult handling and transportation of the units. Detailing the supporting legs as separate elements which could be bolted together on site would simplify the whole process from fabrication through to installation. Design Efficiency - The windows to the stairs required many different size and shaped windows for the vast majority of the openings. Detailing the staircase construction with the same window shapes and sizes would simplify the construction and future maintenance process and is likely to result in reduced cost. CEM and CRE to agree the design delivery schedule with the Network Rail Project Engineer and schedule the design responsibilities for each design partner including design liabilities. The total number of F003 design submissions to Network Rail needs to be clearly identified and these responsibilities then need to be effectively communicated to all design parties and officially detailed in each designers contract conditions. Recommend that the CEM, CRE and appointed designer(s) review the GI available and make a judgement on whether this is sufficient for the proposed solution. Senior Project team to review the commercial, programme and reputational risk to the project of proceeding with limited GI. Recommend the early engagement of piling designer and installer so they can bring their experience to the project. Pennine recommended that early site visits with the site team could influence the design solution by agreeing what piling plant was possible to use in each location, and tailoring the pile design to suit the plant. Continue to foster a collaborative working environment with our client and our supply chain and promote the positive results that this can deliver. Although problems were encountered on site the speed and manner in which a solution was identified and implemented was very positive. CRE to thoroughly review the design details with the site delivery team and introduce our experience in buildability to the design. Designer to learn from this and introduce in future designs. Promote joint site visits with the design team to highlight construction issues which could be made easier on future schemes. This will help develop the skills of designers and increase the experience of younger design team members. Promote the benefits of implementing robust Technical Query controls and how when used well this process can be a very comprehensive way of implementing change control. Recommend to the Murphy Engineering team that on similar applications, consideration should be given to detailing separate support legs/columns with bolted connections to the landings as this will be easier to transport and install. When reviewing similar designs consider detailing the same sized window openings throughout the staircase. This will lead to reduced cost and simpler site installation."
"Site delivery team remained the same for the duration of the works with morale on site consistently high. Site team seen as very effective once works was released from the design. The adoption of the Feedback Friday scheme was seen as a success – It was generally agreed that this forum gave all site operatives a platform to contribute to the delivery of the works and that their ideas and suggestions made the site operatives take greater ownership of the works including the health and safety environment that the works was to be delivered in. This also applied to subcontractors. Allocation of a full time yard man was seen as extremely positive. Continue to promote the positive effect of setting up a core delivery team for the whole duration of the works. This has led to a consistent site team familiar with the works, the compound and plant arrangements. Promote the positive effects of the Feedback Friday scheme. Continue to promote the recommendation and subsequent decision that on large CP5 schemes a full time operative will be allocated with sole responsibility for the yard/compound."
"Mott MacDonald instructed/requested to carry out additional design duties to those they had originally tendered which they accepted, however, the commercial team did not control this process comprehensively as IFL (increased financial limits) were raised on their existing account but accurate descriptions of their additional responsibilities and liabilities were not recorded. This led to some confusion when the JMS commercial team was changed during the life of the scheme. Ensure that change control procedures when instructing designers to carry out additional works are followed and recorded efficiently."
"Very good feedback from Stannah the lift subcontractor on the quality and accuracy of the lift shafts – this made their installation much more efficient. Very good feedback on the quality of the brickwork to the lift shafts. One large element of the steel superstructure was found to have significant impact damage after it had been installed. The section in question was delivered at night and lifted straight off the wagon and installed in its permanent position. Inspection during the day reveals that several of the main structural welds have been damaged. Further investigation identifies that the damage was most likely done at the painting shop or during loading or delivery to site. A meeting with all parties was quickly convened and a repair solution was agreed and the implementation programmed at the soonest opportunity. The supervision and inspection of the repairs were very well controlled. The damage had considerable programme and cost implications. Commend the site team on a good quality installation and reinforce that delivering a good quality product makes follow on trades much more efficient. Commend the site team on a good quality installation and reinforce that setting up good access and good quality controls on site will lead to praise from our client. Inspections had taken place at the fabrication shop and during the painting operation but no final inspection was carried out when the section was loaded for delivery to site. Consider requirement from subcontract steel fabricator to carry out full and final checks prior to delivery on site. The process of agreeing a repair was done quickly and in a very collaborative way. Promote similar ways of working on future sites. Subsequent inspection regime for the repair was very robust – this gave our client a lot of confidence in the integrity of the repair, ensure that this is also the case for any future similar issues."
"Site office and welfare arrangements were housed in a local permanent commercial office facility. The use of this facility was praised by the site team as a very good working environment with reliable electricity and data connections. The site team installed a washing machine in the site welfare area, this proved to be very useful for both JMS and subcontract resources for washing overalls and PPE etc. Lots of very positive feedback from the site delivery team and supply chain partners on the facility to wash and dry clothes on site. Site delivery team demonstrate a very positive proactive attitude to safety on site – this was reinforced by values embedded during the JMS Culture Development Programme CDP. Regular visits by the CDP coaches worked well to maintain this culture on site. For works in urban locations explore the availability of hiring commercial properties for the site offices and welfare requirements. Promote the installation of a washing machine where possible on schemes where site operatives are exposed to dirty/muddy conditions. Promote the positive effect that the CDP is having on site teams."
" Due to delays during demolition on the core possession and having to hand back the line after 32 hours we were unable to land the pilaster parapets during the core possession. After installing the pilasters there was a gap between these and the steel parapet on the four corners of the bridge deck which required a closing panel from the steel parapet supplier. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence. We had to use the contingency possession the following weekend to install the pilasters and approach parapets which resulted in the bridge being closed to the farmer for an additional week, which he required additional compensation for. This took considerable time to get approved and manufactured. They had to come and do a site measure before drawing it up and submitting for approval. This was compounded by the fact that requirement for the closing panels was missed by the site team until late in the project and these were only installed after the team had left site. Include the closing panels in the subcontract to streamline the process."
" We pre-weakened the bridge during the weeknights before the possession by diamond coring. We planned to use diamond wire saws to cut the steel beams and remaining concrete but this was not practical during the core possession. While installing the approach parapets we had difficulty in lining up the brickwork on the different panels. When the bridge was landed on the bearings, there was approx. 10mm gap on the NW and SE bearings. TATA were informed of this but a reason for this could not be established. When installing the precast concrete approach parapets the crew on site were concerned about the stability of the units as they appear to be top-heavy. We had to break out the concrete around the steel beams using a mini digger and hand breakers and burn the steel beams with oxy/acetylene which added to our core possession programme. We had equipment and personnel on standby as contingency. This was an aesthetic problem, which the NWR maintainer was not concerned about as it was not detrimental to the longevity of the structure. The gap for the two bearings were measured up, and the required thickness of bearing ordered. These were then installed during later possessions. TATA had completed calculations to prove they were stable. There was also some signs of cracking of the existing brickwork possibly due to the weight of the units. To put the site team at ease we should consider placing a reinforced concrete slab under the approach units. This would also reduce the requirement for screeding and other preparation for placing the units."
 The end approach parapets had an angled return relative to the face of the brickwork. Brickwork was detailed on the roadside face of the approach parapets. Insitex ‘Lincoln’ finish indicated on the construction drawings. After the bridge was installed and surfacing laid a hairline crack appeared in the tarmac along the joint between the bridge and abutments at both sides. After the bridge was assembled and trial erected at site there were eight Tension Control bolts at both ends of each of the two joints that could not be accessed due to the position of the cill. The drainage of the approach road on the east side is causing the farmer concern. The dowel bars were detailed as being vertical. If the end panel returned square to the face of the brickwork it would give a ‘cleaner’ look to the end of the units. Consider having no brickwork on panels to reduce cost and make installation easier. This needs to be considered in relation to planning requirements. Precast supplier indicated that they could offer a cost saving if an alternative finish was used. We should consider this for future projects as there would be a cost saving. This was picked up by the maintainer. We subsequently did a 30mm deep saw cut and sealed it with a flexible sealant. Greater consideration should be given to the movement joint for future projects. These bolts had to be installed once the bridge was lifted off the cills during the core possession. The design team should consider if it’s possible to move the position of the end stiffening plates so that all TCB bolts were accessible. We has to have two TCB shear wrenches on site for the possession (one as a spare). From speaking to TATA this is not always possible to move the position of the stiffener plates. A site visit in October with the farmer did show some localised erosion of the bank below the low point of the road and the field was also a lot wetter local to the bottom of the embankment. We may need to go back and do remedial work for this area. TATA have said that on other projects they have detailed dowel bars that are at an angle to allow headroom so they could be installed independent of the core possessions.
Use of Land & Marine Temporary works team due to workload of TW team in Golborne. Demolition: Stability of existing parapets when bridge deck has been removed. Temporary Works were very cumbersome and time-consuming to install. The temporary works team from Land & Marine had limited experience in the rail environment which caused late availability of design. It also meant that some designs were more complicated than necessary or overdesigned. Using the in house TW team in Golborne would eliminate this problem. Consider getting Land & Marine TW team to work more closely with Golborne TW team. As per NOC 15 a better temporary works solution & easier one to be used. The temporary were installed as per the design but took a lot of time to install. Projects from the north west use a much simpler and quicker to install push/pull prop and concrete kentledge block system.
 The use of agency staff was required during the core possessions at Easter and on other sections of the works The quality of people were mostly good but sometimes there was a rotation of staff. Where possible we should try to use JMS labour.
" Good service provided by the plant team in Dinnington . Some minor issues with items staying on the hire list even though they were off hired, but overall the plant and equipment supplied by JMS and hire companies was of a good standard. Problems were sorted quickly."
" Dowel bars were high grade stainless steel, which were expensive to buy and were a long lead item. Deliveries of stone for the compound and crane pads took longer than planned. We were requesting 400-500t per day and some days we were only getting 100-150t. JMS structures team in the north west generally install high grade reinforcing steel dowels, which are relative inexpensive to buy and easy to get hold of. TATA to investigate if these would be acceptable in LNE area? This meant that the crane pad was completed just in time for the core possession rather than two weeks beforehand as programmed. It also meant that the plant was not working efficiently. We need to have an alternative supplier available at all times because to take time to set up alternative suppliers."
 Use of Crossways Scaffold and Ainscough Crane Hire. Both companies had proven ability on other JMS contracts of this nature and they were selected based on this. Both companies performed well on site.
 When TATA went to visit the precast concrete suppliers they realised that they did not have the latest revision of AFC drawings. TATA did not issue drawings directly to Banagher Precast due to commercial arrangements. permission (subject to commercial arrangements) to issue the drawings directly to suppliers as required. If we had a site document controller on site from the start of the project they could be responsible for the control of drawings and deign information. We should also consider a SHAREPOINT type document issue platform that was usable by all parties.
 The brickwork on the approach parapets were installed in the precast factory. The pointing was not in compliance with the AFC drawings and NWR specifications .The brickwork pointing had to be re-pointed on site.
"Site Set-up. Welfare Facilities. The compound was set up on land immediately adjacent to the site with adequate hard standing for welfare, storage and parking. There was possibly too much area stripped and stoned up leading to additional stone costs and time to lay and subsequently remove. Welfare was of a good standard. Later in the project when the numbers on site reduced, a welfare van was hired to reduce costs."
"No major environmental incidents. Recycle Of stone Material. Removal of Waste from site. Good outcome for the project. When removing the compound and crane pad, approximately 1500T of stone was recycled from NOC13 to NOC 15 for use in the roadway & any that was left over was given to local farmers with proper waste exemptions to reuse at no cost to the Alliance. Waste was segregated and recycled where possible. We used excavator mounted shears and pulveriser to process the old bridge after removal and all material was recycled."
" Turning Area For HGV’s for PC Units & 1000T Crane. Third Steel beam bolted to PC Parapet. Locally break out concrete around lifting points during possession as shackle would not fit. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence. Required to be planned & done by main contractor early. TATA unable to get involved due to lack of experience of construction matters. Terrafirma product used was a great product. This saved us time on site during possession as we handed the Leeds lines back with 10 Minutes to spare. Also it meant less rebar to be fixed on site at a later date. When PC Concrete contractor Constructed the Parapets the lifting points did not take into account the lifting equipment that would be used during the Easter weekend. This caused us a problem on the night for which we had to break out areas to get the lifting tackle inserted. We should identify on the drawings a suitably sized box-out around the lifting point."
"Size Of turning areas & location for turning trucks. Demolition : Stability of existing parapets when bridge deck has been removed. Piling for crane outriggers. Road Closure 2 weeks prior to Easter possession. Maintaining Pedestrian & cyclist access throughout the works. Ensure ecological surveys are covered where applicable. As per Noc 13 a better temporary works solution & easier one to be used. Experience from Manchester bridges came up with the solution to support the parapets which was used to great effect and time wise, but could have caused us major delays otherwise. Ensure this is checked out on trial erection. The piling design along with Gi reports were very late which meant that the pile cap bases for the crane pads were constructed at last minute. The road would also need to be closed earlier to give us & our subcontractors a chance to develop. This could have been a show stopper if any failure of the pile caps to reach strength. Road closure was not granted until 2 weeks prior to possession. This was not adequate and feedback from our structures teams in the Manchester area was that we should have a minimum of 4-6 weeks closure prior to the main possession. We believe we could have finished the project weeks earlier if a full closure was granted or an alternative access route across the structure was implemented, possibly a separate structure from station road end."
". Design team contracted to Network Rail but could not take instruction from Jms/Real Alliance (Contractor). Burning holes in sheet piles for capping beam Onerous Task. Delay in Design of Road Alignment. Crash Barrier upgraded. AFC Drawings. Technical Queries not Consistent..i.e Volker , Alliance & JMS TQ’s raised. Palisade Fence design to be detailed for Bolton Percy including footings. Trial Holes & Reports. Tata were working for Network rail on an alliance but Alliance could not instruct them as they had a separate contract with Network rail. This was frustrating for all parties & design suffered on the contract. The design of the capping beam required 3 holes in each pile to be burnt which was onerous and could not be planned properly. It was done in piece meal & cost a lot more than anticipated. ….Designers maybe look at an alternative method to attach rebar. Original solution was for sheet piles but with a view to value engineering Keller solution for soil nailing was looked at but after a lengthy time investigating this it was inefficient. TATA went back to the original sheet piling method but had lost 3 months in time submitting for approval to NYCC who took a long time to approve. Also Tata negotiated with NYCC but expressed disappointment with lack of presence from Network Rail. Crash Barrier upgrade from N2 to N2W1 which meant twice as many posts which meant more Labour time costs. The construction of the road was complete & it was realised by the designer that 3 AFC drawings were not issued which may have helped our engineers production on site…TATA not contracted to the Alliance….The designer should be able to work hand in hand will all parties going forward. Technical query to be one approved document going forward. All future fencing of this nature to be approved by design going forward. TATA want more information in repots going forward, and more timely production of reports."
" Temporary works design for the Parapets. Engaging Ainscough sooner to produce TWD for lifting. ALO & permits to load/strike paperwork worked well. Land & Marine were asked to produce, they went to Maybe in the end we used conventional method used on all bridges in Manchester structures side. Lift plans & rams to be issued earlier going forward."
Agency staff used on core possessions due to workloads throughout the company & area. Document controller on site too late. Getting a setting out Engineer difficult. Always try to use JMS labour where possible going forward. Get JMS Document controller (or agency if necessary) on site at the start of the project.
Dinnington Plant department supportive throughout . Good.
"The process from requisitioning to receipt on site was too onerous due to the alliance process. Surplus Materials. Deliveries of stone for the compound and crane pads took longer than planned. We were requesting 400-500t per day and some days we were only getting 100-150t. Concrete deliveries caused some frustration at site due to the fact that we had to give two or three days’ notice for deliveries. Some mixes were coming one supplier and another mix from a different supplier due to availability and price. Some pours had to be postponed due to non-availability of concrete. This onerous process cost time & money in some cases whilst trying to get everyday materials to site. This was an ongoing topic throughout the contract. Surplus materials left over , bricks blocks cement etc were conveyed by e mail to other JMS jobs The Real Alliance PPE was also distributed back into the Real alliance for use on PSU. This meant that the site compound was completed about two weeks later than programmed. It also meant that the plant and labour were not working efficiently. We need to have an alternative supplier available at all times because to take time to set up alternative suppliers. On several occasions we had concrete deliveries in the afternoon rather than in the morning despite having it booked for and confirmed for the morning. The action would be always get two quotes and two mix designs approved from different suppliers and have orders set up with both."
Three Shires Ltd installed the closed panel palisade fencing to the four wing walls incorrectly. Protek Crash barrier Installation. Use of Crossways Scaffold. causing a train line to be stopped for safety reasons. This fencing was made safe and removed later in the day once we got an emergency team to site. We got Three Shires to remove the panels from the other three embankment walls. The preliminary investigation to the near miss highlighted that the fence was not installed correctly and that there was no design competed for the footings for the increased loading due to the closing panels. This company were NYCC main crash barrier installers & their relationship with NYCC helped in speeding up the design approval and installation process on site. We used the same contractor that the crews in the north west use to install scaffold and they provided a good service.
 commencement requested by NR with not enough risk allowed. Possession allowances too low. Interfaces between designers & external/Alliance caused many delays & additional costs. Tendered Account & Final Account significant over run. Going forward risk allowances to be valued fully. Going forward a look at the alliance/design input also.
 Handover documentation ongoing throughout the contract. Ongoing & continuous.
 Traffic management was managed by Centurion who knew the area & the workings of NYCC. Good site set up & welfare facilities at Bolton Percy to accommodate all involved.
" Nature Reserve & Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Newt fencing. All waste managed correctly. There was probably a lot more material taken off site than anticipated & planned for. Approximately 1500T of stone was recycled from NOC 13 to NOC 15 & consequently any that was left over was given to local farmers with proper waste exemptions to reuse at no cost to the Alliance. Good relationship with Brian Lavelle (YWT) for whom we helped with some work for his trust & he in turn helped us with any matters relating to works on their boundaries. Newt fencing to be far more extensive in the future to enable us to continue working as it had to be relocated several times, hindering work. It also need repair because it was too close to the work areas."
We used a local tea room to supply food for the crews on day and night shifts over the Easter core possession. JMS made a donation the Bolton Percy Cricket club in exchange for using a framers field for access/turning for the Easter weekend. This was good use of local resources and also assisted with their turnover which was down due to us having the road closed at the bridge. Good community relations.
" When the construction issue drawings were issued the subcontractor came up with several proposals that would make fabrication more straightforward and make installation more straight forward, offering a cost saving. These took time to get approved which added to the programme. While drilling the holes for the parapet extensions we kept hitting the top structural member of the bridge parapet. We could not drill through this as it would weaken the structure. We had to re-drill a lot of the holes causing time and cost delays. There was also limited room to drill the new holes as the relatively short dimension of the vertical face of the new panel. For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence. Getting the designers to engage with the specialised subcontractor early in the works would allow us to tap into their expertise, which would assist in producing designs that are more constructible. This would reduce the fabrication and installation times. A longer overlap down the vertical face of the new parapet would have made it easier to locate the new extension pieces onto the existing sheeting as the holes could have been located well clear of the structural elements."
" Gap between the new parapet extension and the existing panels was quite big and in some cases needed to be filled with a sealant. This was due to the overlap on the existing panels and the rivets used to close these panels. This was compounded by the fact that the new panels were fabricated from 8mm plate, and the existing were 3mm thick. The corner piece on the access ramp was difficult to fabricate and needed site fitting before being removed to complete fabrication and coating. Manufacturing the parapet extensions from 3mm plate rather than 8mm plate would allow more flexibility in the panels to reduce the gap. Match[1]marking and drilling an oversize hole on the extension panel over each rivet would also reduce the gap. Designers could put notes on the drawing where contractors need to pay particular attention to fabrication."
 Design was done using As[1]built drawings from the previous bridge works. Inaccuracies in these drawings lead to complications on site. There was no site visit by the design team prior to producing the drawings. Very heavy beams and panels used for the anti-trespass panels on the road bridge. This caused major construction issues as the panels needed to be mechanically lifted (Hiab) into place. This was quite difficult as we were using a bridge inspection truck to access the work area. Designers should go to site early in the design to confirm that as built drawings are accurate. They should also allow for additional length panels to allow for site tolerances or misalignment of existing structures. Also consider using slotted holes to allow more tolerance. Using lighter steel sections and anti-trespass panels would remove the need for mechanical lifting which would make the work easier and safer to complete. There was correspondence between the designers and NWR about the size/weight of these items. Designers to confirm what correspondence took place to determine if there’s a way to reduce the size and weight of these panels. A thinner panel with stiffener ribs could possibly be used.
" All fabrication and installation works were let on a supply and install contract. Safety Critical Staff. This minimised the requirement for JMS resources and meant that specialised, experience workers were able to complete the installation. This is a very good way to let contracts where the majority of work is to be completed by specialised contractors. Coyle provided all safety critical staff on the TPE project. On one occasion a COSS from Coyle didn’t show up for one shift, resulting in aborted costs for Bridge inspection truck, Hiab, subcontractors personnel and JMS Supervision totalling almost £5k."
" A bridge inspection truck was used to access much of the work on the outside of the road bridge, instead of using rail mounted MEWP’s. This eliminated the need for RRAP’s and additional safety critical MEWP personnel. It also had a shorted set-up time allowing for more production time on site. All specialist plant came from approved JMS framework suppliers, who provided good plant and with the required certification and competent operators if required. Plant supplied by JMS/REAL was of a good standard as was plant supplied by our subcontractors. Consider including the use of these trucks when designing the works to maximise their usefulness. We kept in regular contact with suppliers and the plant department in Dinnington to ensure things ran smoothly. Continue to use approved framework suppliers."
" Use of Lindapter and other specialised fixings saved time on site due to the fact that there was no requirement to access the line side of the bridge to install a nut. Once the parapet extensions were initialled and sufficient fixings installed to prevent movement, the remaining fixings could be drilled and installed during the day from a high street environment. All materials and sundry items were supplied by the specialised fabrication and installation contractor. All materials were delivered to site and were stored in a Lock[1]up container by subcontractor. Some items had to be bespoke manufactured or modified to suit existing structure causing delays. Even though the cost of the bolts were considerably more than a standard bolt there was still time and cost savings due to the fact that the majority of the installation could be done during the day from the footpath. This meant that work did not need to happen at night during possessions, reducing labour costs and giving longer, more productive working shifts. Consider specifying these on parapet extension projects and the cost could be built into the price. This worked well as they were able to manage deliveries and storage to suit their needs. This proved to be a good way of storing materials and ensuring that all materials were on site in time for installation. Having notes on the drawings of areas where contractor should check existing site structures for fitment would have allowed the contractor to identify the problem area earlier and reduce the effects."
"WEC Rail were used as specialist fabrication and installation contractor for NOC 22 and NOC 22A parapet extensions. Safety Critical Staff. Coyle provided all safety critical staff on the TPE project (except POS and ALO staff). On one occasion a COSS from Coyle didn’t show up for one shift, resulting in aborted costs for Bridge inspection truck, Hiab, subcontractors personnel and JMS Supervision totalling almost £5k. They had good fabrication facilities and extensive workforce. They worked well on site and had a proactive attitude to work and problems solving if/when they arose on site. Their Rail division has lost some key team members during the project which caused a lack of continuity. Preferably use in house safety critical staff. Consider using alternative provider."
". The fact that the designers were contracted to NWR, and not JMS/REAL Alliance meant that we had limited ability to direct/influence design team. Tender estimate was low due to estimating from Form 2 drawings which changed considerably by the time construction issue drawings were issued. Four TQ’s were raised by the site team, which were answered by the design team and/or NWR as appropriate. Significant project overrun due to design problems and the requirement to bespoke fabricate certain items. There should be some mechanism in the contract for JMS to engage with the designers to a greater extent. We need the facility for the designers to flexibly engage with specialist subcontractors for fabrication of specialised works. Get the design team on board as early as possible. Get specialised contractors engaged as early as possible to allow them to have input to the development of the design. This should lead to more constructible solutions."
Parapet extension panels were delivered to site with paint scratches. Records handover was an ongoing process. Touch up painting required at site. Consider using alternative coating product that is tougher.
"Site Set-up. Welfare Facilities. Traffic Management. The compound was set up on land immediately adjacent to the site with adequate space for welfare, storage and parking. Welfare was of a good standard. Later in the project when the numbers on site reduced, a welfare van was hired to reduce costs. Traffic management was completed by a local company who are the framework contractor for the local authority. Their good working relationship with the local authority ensured that traffic management was correctly executed on all occasions. TM was to a good standard, with good equipment etc."
Incidents. Waste Management. No environmental incidents. Good environmental practices on site. Low environmental risk as there was minimum plant requirements and only small amounts of chemicals used. All waste was segregated and recycled where possible.
NWR Structure Maintainer required additional locking nuts on the anti-trespass panels on the lower ramps due to having a similar problem on other structures (unrelated to this project) even though no locking nuts were detailed on construction drawings. Maintainer would not sign off the punch list until locking nuts were installed. Consider detailing ‘Nylok’ type locking nuts as standard.
"CD 100 dictated the requirements of Progress & Programme. Key dates included in programme. Murphy International provided piling for the project. The programme for the project is constructed to cover the specific requirements of UU. We managed this element well; JP & AK undertook this as well as production of Progress Report which enabled AK to gain more experience of managing the programme (P6). Client was satisfied as JMS met all key dates. Murphy International were involved early and collaborated well with the NW Region, provided a commercial advantage as within the company. The programme has been used as a basis for all new tenders for UU."
"Site / Office set-up. Construction method. Construction method. Construction method. Test &Commissioning. Site set up undertaken well, good layout produced at tender stage. Plenty of space provided and well segregated cabins and site areas. UU’s PM allowed connection to permanent sewer, water and power. New cabins were supplied by Plant & Transport for this project which created a good impression with the client. Ring beam designed/constructed which ultimately saved costs in piling reinforcement of approximately £36000. Murphy International allowed for more steel than required in tender, the construction method not fully understood, resulting in impact on programme, costing 3 weeks. Concrete overspills from piling, approximately 200m3 - hired rock-wheel at £700/week to break off surplus concrete. Good sub contractors used with prior knowledge of UU processes."
Frequent Design meetings with UU kept them up to speed and highlighted issues with non-approval from them.
JMS need staff who are well experienced and knowledgeable in temporary works and understand the costs involved in the designs produced. Employed an Engineer with the training and experience in structures.
"Labour. Confined Spaces training. Generally very good – as a Company we do carry a lot of operatives with varying backgrounds that were called upon to deliver specific elements such as Bricklaying, grouting. Employed two local people who were very good – we took one of these onto next scheme. Used a local organisation, Lawsons, for a confined spaces course, feedback from staff attending was that the course was very unsatisfactory, also encountered issues with obtaining certificates."
"Issues with the quality of internal and external plant supplied to the project. Trench box had to be left in the excavation as could not remove. A few issues with internal hydraulic breaker, internal 20T excavator, internal silt-buster (supplied damaged) and crane supplied by outside source to replace our own. The external crane had 3 breakdowns and was condemned twice under LOLER examination. The JMS crane was removed to another project at a critical time of Contract....... This cost the project £7500."
"Selection of supplier. Some concrete elements produced pre-cast in supplier’s premises. Handy Concrete used to supply concrete, who had only previously been used on smaller concrete projects for Rail, however, were found to be satisfactory for the larger pours. Armstrongs Pre-cast Concrete used for pre-cast items (roof) – made in yard at Flimby – very good set up at their yard and good finishes produced. APC are continued to be used to price work."
Availability of records. Murphy International records for the piling works were retained on site which allowed JMS to foresee any problems upfront.
JMS staff were trained in use of Business collaborator by UU and found it very good and easy to use.
"Audit report. A Group audit was undertaken of the project, but it was months before the report was issued by the auditor. CAR raised on cube tank not being at correct temperature – remember to plug in."
"Traffic management & traffic/pedestrian segregation. Welfare. Buried services – wrong equipment for the task. Management of HAVs. Identification of confined space. Good traffic management and traffic / pedestrian segregation on site and also between the compound and site. Separate entrances to site and to compound. Welfare could have been kept cleaner – had issues with the contracted cleaner. Hit rising main with excavator bucket trying to remove concrete from pipe – plan and use correct equipment for the job. Breaker used was not in good condition – HAVS could have been managed better (improvement programme now in place in NW Region). Excavation was initially considered a confined space, however on further inspection found not to be."
Waste Transfer Notes. WTN not fully completed – remember to use season ticket instead of separate notes for each transfer.
"Understanding responsibilities. IT – use of dongles. CCTV camera did not work. JMS maintained fencing for smooth lizards, where this was actually the responsibility of the Client. More communication required. Dongles did not provide adequate connectivity to the system, resulting in frustrating the staff and works. BT contacted too late for installation of a landline prior to project commencement. IT is reactive, would be more helpful to projects if more proactive in finding solutions to IT connectivity problems. CCTV camera costing £3500 installed, at request of Client to record time-lapse of the progress of works (tank). Installed by sub contractor in wrong place and only found to have not worked at the completion of the project as could not check at the time of installation due to lack of IT connectivity. Staff felt uncomfortable about the camera as it covered the whole site, not the area it was supposed to."
Allowed the team to discuss and resolve any issues collaboratively. It focused all the team on resource planning. Key resources were kept informed and available at the right time. Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined. A big positive was that all meetings were on site. 5 minute stand downs were used to focus on the way any task was being undertaken ‘was there a better way’. The team showed great commitment to the in detail planning of the core possessions in a collaborative manner. Valuable de risking was achieved by giving detailed consideration to carrying out any upfront work we could prior to the blockade. Buildability reviews were carried out and seen as a must have by the Project Team. Is that all projects should do this in some way. It is important that the wider Project are involved. Develop the plan in a structured manner to include all the Stakeholders. Agree the plan with all parties then stick to it. 1. Formulate the hour by hour plan and define the owners line by line. 2. Design process must include buildability reviews. 3. QRSA should go thru buildability in more detail.
"Beams were trial erected in Ireland. Some good and bad issues with this. Great opportunity to identify issues early and rectify. Estimated that ironing out the problems saved a possession. Downside was it was not seen as high priority by the team. The methodology and specification for the requirements of the trial were not fully agreed and defined. The attending team did not fully understand the requirement when attending the trial. Lessons 1. Develop a specification, methodology and set of check sheets to be issued as part of the subcontract and owned by Engineering. 2. Make sure that all off site manufacture has a trial erection and pre-ship testing regime issued with the tender."
"Design Issues Design brief did not reflect the constructability or site requirement/temporary works The Quality of design brief should have been better. Changing staff caused issues/planning resource. The Design was on the shelf not reviewed late submission to NR lost valuable time. Tolerance standard design, tolerances too tight Designer/Murphy felt tolerances were adequate. Quality control being manufacture fell down in some areas. The interface between the Pway and civils was not detailed enough. Required more detailed checks between all parties relating to Pway. Track design should be issued with tender Detail plan the design review process manage it and meet regularly from the start of the project. The temporary works design brief did not adequately reflect all of the constructability temporary works requirements, which could be improved in future. Changing staff within the Murphy design management team and the associated lack of continuity through the project resulted in a number of issues and delays during the design phase. Once of these was that there was a delay between receipt of the Permanent works design and its subsequent onward submission to Network Rail. This resulted in an overall delay to the design approval, which could have been mitigated to some degree. The installation tolerance (specifically related to the location of bridge bearings onto cill units) was specified in accordance to the relevant NR standard design drawings. Hindsight showed that this should be improved on future projects. It is noted that during the review of the design this issue was discussed and at that time the Designer/Murphy felt that the tolerances were adequate. Issues were highlighted regarding the Quality control (during manufacture) of the precast concrete cill units. Specifically a number of dimensional errors were made, which were not identified until the units arrived on site. These errors resulted in reduced tolerances for installation of the bearings onto the cill units, and are therefore closely related to the design tolerance provision described above. No P-way design was included with the ITT. An assumption was made at tender stage that the alignment design of the tracks would be straight forward and that tie in positions would be close to the bridge. In addition, a number of assumptions related to vertical alignment were made in the development of the bridge scheme, which resulted in difficulties in obtaining technical approval of the PWay Form A. BY the time these issues were resolved the project programme dictated that a number of compromises were necessary with respect to the bridge."
"Site Team; There was a great team ethic which was thought to come from the team being together and knowing each other well. No us and them everyone was approachable and listened. Network rail were very supportive and really motivated the teams by encouraging and engaging with the workforce. P Way Gang 1. Not many P Way contractors out there 2. Decided to micro manage Stobarts – good idea/result 3. Re-instatement 4. Stobart used agency Ops not competent/no experience 5. Not motivated 6. People on zero hour contract 7. Didn’t adapt to the programme changes 8. Given drainage and Civil. In future just use for P way 1. Site agent changed after a few weeks 2. No commercial relationship staff, Changing every 4-6 weeks, continuity required. 3. Some roles and responsibilities not clear 4. Loss of momentum causes issues 5. CEM changed caused some delay/ learning curve. Availability of some information amalgamated with the above caused unnecessary problems and learning curves. Specify to the supply chain exactly what we expect particularly work ethic and culture. Make sure competencies are submitted with tender. Emphasise no subcontracting without written permission from the Project Manager. Lesson Records and documentation must be visible to project by allocating wider file access and collaborative internet based filing systems."
"1. Inspections must be by a competent person in that discipline 2. Poor Finish due to rushing 2 and half weeks to cast 3. Design management across the project caused us programme issues. 4. More attention to the planning or pre-construction phase. The bridge deck and cill arrangement were trial erected at the steelwork fabrication yard. However, a number of issues were noted that should be improved for future projects. It is noted that the value of the trial erection was proven and negated installation issues from arising during the core possession. Where component fit and erection methodology are considered critical then trial erections should be undertaken on future projects. Dimensional checks on key components should be made and verified prior to the trial erection. • Appropriate materials should be provided (sand, shims etc.) such that site conditions can be replicated correctly. This should be provide in a specification to the steelwork fabricator in advance to avoid delays during the trial erection. • Adequate space should be made at the fabricators site to enable the trial Erection to take place. • The trial erections should be planned appropriately, and detailed in a WPP or similar such that those involved understand the requirements in advance. • The trial erections should be undertaken by the team who will install the bridge on site rather than by the steelwork fabricator in advance of the site team arriving at the fabricators premises. 1. Supplier should specify to us their pre-cast & manufacturing test regime. 2. A blank drawing of the precast drawing should be filled in by the Supplier at his precast inspection to show actual dimensions before the pour rather than rely on design drawings. The supplier should specify to us their pre-cast & manufacturing test regime which must be reviewed and accepted by Murphy. Adherence to this procedure must be audited during the quality checks undertaken by Murphy’s representative at the manufacturing site. Dimensional checks of the units should be undertaken at key stages of their manufacture. Measured dimensions should be marked on drawings for direct comparison with design values such that immediate validation and subsequent auditing can be undertaken to ensure accuracy. Simple tick boxes stating that checks have been undertaken are not considered sufficiently robust. Dimensions MUST be recorded and verified."
1. Engaged with the locals face to face to explain what we are doing. 2. Local Councillor took old parapets to use as monument. 3. Plaque on bridge to commemorate the original builders. 4. Involved all the locals/stakeholders 5. No complaints 6. Went to schools .1. Try to involve the local community as early as we can. Keep them informed.
"1) Programme went well and time frame – project was completed on time. 2) Mainly a sub-contracted job and they gave us a programme for their works – We were then able to co[1]ordinate the various works including sprinklers with concrete base and service trench, lighting, comfort heating, upgrade of amenity blocks & upgrade of electrical supply. 3) Amazon, who will be renting Mammoth, was involved with the whole process and took part in the monthly meetings. 4) We initially had trouble trying to get hold of the right person to organise the gas connection via British Gas. It took a total of 3no. weeks to speak to the correct person who we managed to plan/ organise the gas connection with. 1) Ensure all future projects are programmed well & feasible to meet the contract completion date. 2) No action required 3) No action required 4) To save time on future projects, if we require a gas connection via British Gas, we should be aware that it may take a long leading time & attempt to make contact at an earlier stage."
"We had a day and night security guard on this project that you had to go to, to enter & exit site. 2) The site set-up we had for Mammoth was suited for the project. 3) There was minimal setting out works carried out by a sub[1]contractor 4) All mechanical and electrical inspections were independently carried out by Building Services Design Ltd. 5) All other inspections were independently carried out by RLF, who appointed by both JMS & Amazon. 1) On large projects like Mammoth, we should look into having a security guard over CCTV. 2) Ensure that we continue to have a good site set-up for all our projects. 3) No action required 4) On future contracts, perhaps look into appointing an independent consultant to carry out inspections 5) Same as above."
"1) Sprig Little Partnership was the structural engineer for this project appointed by ourselves. Their scope of works were designing the concrete base for sprinkler tank and the big air handling units for the amenity blocks with the structured roof to hold them. They performed very well on this project. 2) Michael Sparks were the architects for this project to organise the planning applications for the sprinkler tank – They also performed very well on this project. 3) Prior to commencing our construction works on project, we were aware that the sprinkler tanks had a long lead time but we managed to programme around it & didn’t have problems with programme. 4) All design works were agreed on the pre-construction meeting – there were very minor changes. 5) Throughout the whole project, we had a great rapport with all the project team and sub[1]contractors which helped meeting the programmed completion date. 1) Inform Buying department of their performance for future use. 2) Same as above 3) On future projects, we should always be aware of the items that require a longer lead time to prevent any delays. 4) Always endeavour to get the design works agreed prior to the commencement of works if possible to prevent delays. 5) We should always endeavour to build a good rapport with everyone involved with the contract including sub-contractors."
1) We scaffold installed around the amenity blocks. 2) We were using MEWP’s mainly for works inside the warehouse. 3) There was no need for installing any hoarding around site due to site already enclosed by palisade fencing. 1) No action required. 2) Assess what method to reach high heights would work prior to works commence. 3) No action required.
1) We had suitable amount of staff & labour on site - 6no. JMS operative and 1no. site manager on site. 2) Everyone on site was suitable to work on this contract and had the necessary training to carry out the works. 1) No action required 2) Always make sure that the persons allocated to the contract are suitable & have the necessary training to carry out the works.
"1) MEWP’s used on site were sub-contractors own. 2) The JMS plant we had on site consisted of 1no. MEWP, 4no. lifting towers, 7T excavator and a dumper – the on & off hiring of plant on site was ok. 1) Request sub-contractors to supply their own plant when possible. 2) We had to chase the plant department to discuss a few items but overall, all plant was on & off hired successfully."
"1) Procurement of the new transformer was critical – through proper planning, we managed to programme around it and we were successful – if this was not highlighted in the beginning and planned accordingly, it would’ve messed up the whole programme. 2) This project did not require ordering of much material. 1) As mentioned before, we should always endeavour to highlight the items that have a long leading time prior to any construction works being carried out. 2) No action required."
"1) All our sub-contractors more or less performed very well and we had built a good rapport with them in order to complete the project successfully. 2) The 3no. main sub[1]contractors that we used on this project were Hall & Kay (sprinklers), RSR (M&E) & FIREX UK (fire alarms). 1) Inform buying department of the performance of all sub-contractors & consultants used on this project for future use on other projects within JMS. 2) Same as above."
"1) It was agreed that £1 million of the contract value will be reimbursed by rent viaAmazon prior to any works commencing. 2) RLF would approve the monthly valuations. 3) Monthly progress meetings were chaired by RLF which helped completing the project and also enabled us to build rapport with the project team. 4) The final account was submitted 1 week after the Amazon handover and no changes/ alterations were required. 1) No action required. 2) As mentioned before, when possible, we should perhaps appoint an independent consultant for inspection. 3) Same as above. 4) No action required."
1) Sue Fullard completed the O&M’s for Mammoth – there were 2no. hardcopies & 2no. cd’s. 2) The handover was a smooth transition. 3) All site records were kept well enabling both a successful project completion and a smooth handover. 1) Inform buying department of their performance for future use on JMS projects. 2) No action required 3) Ensure that we always keep good records on projects.
1) The site set-up and site welfare was adequate for the project and site operatives working on site. 1) Ensure that we always think about the site set-up before hand so that it is suited for the project.
1) All hazardous waste were removed via specialist waste contractor 1) Continue to use JMS procedures when removing hazardous waste from site.
"1) We had problems with the internet connection on site as it was initially slow via BT – we had 5no. site visits before anything was done and a 2 months wait till the broadband connection. 2) Overall, this was a very successful project. 1) Speak to IT and buying and see if there is a way of avoiding long delays on site for broadband in future. 2) No action required."
"1) Project was programmed well with the scope of works & clients requirements. 2) Client instructed some extra works & extra time without. 3) Site team displayed a proactive approach throughout the project and produced high client satisfaction. 1) Ensure that on future projects, we agree to a workable programme with client. 2) This was in agreement & there was no problem with the final valuation. 3) Continue working with a proactive approach."
"1) Site compound space was limited at times & offices were slightly cramped. 2) Offices could do with some refurbishment works such as the lighting, flooring & windows. 3) Despite having very limited space on site, the site layout was always kept tidy. 4) JMS received high satisfaction from both residents and clients for completing works on site. 1) We had to maximise the space we had on site – in future, we should push for more space for site-set ups. 2) Pass on comments to Plant & Transport department to look into for some JMS containers. 3) Continue making housekeeping a priory on site 4) Maintain a good working ethos on site & good relationships with our clients."
"We had no design responsibility on this project & followed a design spec for the kitchens we were installing, after we received approval from the client to do so."
"Other than hoarding & harris fencing installed on site, no other temporary works were done."
"1) We only required a RLO, 1 Site Manager & a visiting QS for this project .1) Continue to resource enough staff to project."
"1) When works started in Dover, a JMS generator from KTY was hired – this meant that when there was any maintenance issue with the generator, it had to be dealt with by a mechanic from KTY which meant longer waiting hours to resolve any issues which was disruptive. 2) Oasis units for Folkestone & Ashford were good quality & fitted in well with the very limited site compound space. 3) Internal plant hire charges have not been correct & despite site manager off hiring plant/ vans, the project was still being charged with the items. 1) In future, we should stick to local hire firms when projects are quite far from KTY. 2) Give Plant dept feedback of the use of Oasis units. 3) Ensure that the plant dept off hire items & credit back the project. – speak to Plant dept."
"1) The kitchen supplier we used had some issues with the quality of the product & some kitchens were designed incorrectly. We had to call their Area Manager several times to resolve these issues which were then resolved over a period of time 1) For refurbishment contracts, in future, we are to put in a request during procurement that we would like 1 kitchen designer to carry out all kitchen designs throughout the project and they are to ensure that the designer is fully trained and competent to carry out the task."
1) W. Martins performed very well throughout the contract & worked well with JMS site team. 2) Sovereign Windows had different teams on site where some teams were better than others which caused site manager to remove 2no. teams from site due to poor quality workmanship on finishes. 1) Ensure positive feedback is given to our Buying dept for future use. 2) Site managers are to check windows and make sure that all windows are to be snagged to quality procedures & to subcontractor method statement.
"1) Good Document control on site & received a 36 point score on CCS 2) Due to excellent rapport with client & rep, JMS were able to negotiate contract phases & we did not require any tendering as it was a continuation from Kent C1. 1) Ensure we continue to have good document control on sites & receive good scores for CCS 2) Keep good rapport with clients."
1) No problems with records and resident problems have been sorted. 2) Ensure Site Managers use the NCR procedure to sort out issues with suppliers & Sub[1]contractors. 1) Ensure we continue to have good record keeping & resolve problems efficiently. 2) Quality Advisor is to brief all Site Managers & QS’s on the NCR procedure.
1) Great site set-up & high clients satisfaction – No Riddors .1) Ensure all site set-up’s are well thought of despite having a small area for a site compound.
1) Skippy Nationwide sent a waste update monthly without fail. 2) Smartwaste was not being updated. 1) Inform buying 2) All site managers are to be informed that updating waste records on smartwaste is a must.
"1) There were a lot of IT issues with internet connection, phones & printer 1) Give IT dept feedback of problems in order to resolve future problems efficiently."
"1) Originally this contract was a 40 week programme which was not realistic & had a short leading time of 2no. weeks. There was not enough time to familiarise with project before programming accurately. 2) The project overran by 26no. weeks in total. EOT requests were issued with 15no. weeks being accepted of the 23no. weeks requested to date. The 3no. remaining weeks is a further request. This is due to weather, variations, procurement & lack of design information. Procurement of contractors led a portion of delays 1) In future we should insist on an adequate leading time for planning and programming. We cannot accept restricted time frames as the tender details will need to be considered before submitting. This project also commenced during a busy period within the building department. 2) Programme monitored regularly and updated and issued to client. In future we are to manage the programme, early warnings & procurement very closely & highlight and document any concerns as soon as they arise. Ensure procurement schedule is issued in time an adhered to."
"1) We had to build our own site offices & welfare services in the back garden as the JMS containers were impossible to bring in. Site set up was adequate & satisfied completion of project. 2) Client & rep were not issuing sufficient/ adequate information such as drawings and dimensions – Several meetings were being carried out “almost like holding their hand” and re-checking if the space was sufficient to install everything. 1) If we are to encounter a situation like this in future, we know we are more than capable of building our own site & welfare offices. 2) The Architect should carry out sufficient surveys and provide accurate information and also spend time on site – not in and then out straight away."
"1) We had no problems with the Mechanical specification & installation on this project. 2) We had some significant difficulties with the electrical works on this project which caused significant impact to programme. This was due to lack of clarity on specification & we had to keep going back to the client for confirmation etc. 3) A lot of issues with the lighting design & no spec issued regarding the wiring & type. 1) The sub-contractor, East West, performed very well on this project & caused no problems in getting the works complete – We will inform the buying dept. 2) In future, we are to confirm that we require a full specification of the electrical works required prior to commencing the project to avoid any unnecessary delays and confusion. 3) See above comment."
"1) Site Manager was aware of the JMS procedure and adhered to it within reason, to complete works. Due to cost being an issue in various areas of the project, a considered view was taken with regards to the extent of all temporary works being carried out in the most cost-effective way possible. 2) When Reg Dalton carried out an internal Audit on this contract, he was very impressed with our new site mangers paperwork on the temporary works. 3) Temporary works was not fully allowed for in the tender of this project. 1) The temporary works procedure will need to be reviewed by all site managers again to ascertain that they are complying with the JMS procedure. 2) Ensure that all site managers continue to make temporary works an important aspect of the project & keep up with the paperwork. 3) All commercial staff to be up to date to all Group Procedures, including Temporary works."
"1) This contract progressed during a busy period within the department and support staff for periods was stretched. 2) Sufficient training for site manager & site operatives was carried out in order for the men to carry out works. 3) A new site manager was due to start this project but was unable to, so we had to get a foreman to organise the site whilst we tried to get a new site manager to start. 1) The quantity of site operatives however, was adequate for site level. We need to assess the extent of resources available to projects. 2) Continue updating the training matrix & records – all courses are organised when required. 3) In future, we should always try and endeavour to have a site manager on the start of the project as it is the crucial point in order to determine what the contract requirements are on site etc."
"1) Plant was hired via Travis Perkins & was very convenient – The only issue was that the site manager did not follow JMS procedure. 1) In future, Site Manager is to follow company procedures and discuss with Plant Department what is required & the best solution."
"1) Sand supplier changed quarries which caused site manager looking for the same sand from Quarry – the same sand was needed in order to complete some pointing on the brickwork 2) Storing materials was difficult as there was no storage space on site and unable to bulk buy some of the items such as bricks, tiles & sand etc. 3) Some suppliers were put on stop which caused big programming issues on site. 4) Client nominated a lot of suppliers and materials for materials which had long leading times that caused delays i.e. doors. 5) The windows that were specified on this project from Mardec Joinery were on stop. This caused us having to work out-of[1]sequence and some delays were caused. 1) It took the Site manager 2no. working days to find the same sand to complete the brickwork – it was time consuming but due to his proactive approach, he was successful finding the same sand despite being told by the buyer & supplier it would take a week to locate. 2) We had to purchase items in small quantities & utilise the building shed in KTY when possible. 3) All suppliers are to be paid once invoices have been received as per the agreed terms. 4) When this happens in future, ascertain what is required and procure as soon as possible. 5) Every effort was put into this to avoid any delays but could have easily been resolved if we were informed that we were on stop & was resolved as soon as possible."
"1) The procurement for sub[1]contractors was slow thought the contract. 2) The sub-contractor QMS were difficult to work with and caused approximately 4-5 weeks delay. 3) We had quite a few good sub-contractors thatperformed well on this project such as East West, Greenlake, JJ Ashpalt etc 4) We also had a few sub[1]contractors who did not perform as well as they should have on this contract and caused a few problems such as Wiggintons, D&M, Hatfull Brothers Joinery. 5) We used Danny O’Sullivan agency labourers on this project and they performed adequately. 1) On future contracts, ensure that we meet with the buyer prior to the works commencing on site for them to be aware of our requirements for the project and draw up a procurement schedule. 2) Ensure that the buying department are informed of their performance via the performance questionnaire. 3) Performance questionnaires will be completed & issued to buying department. 4) See above comment 5) On future projects if we have projects that requires multi-skilled labour, we may use D. O’Sullivan again."
"1) Not enough given time to price the job has affected estimate for the job. 2) Contract documents received from client were inadequate and further information would have been required for an accurate estimate. 3) Issuing CVI’s/ variations were not flagged/ identified as the job progressed. 4) Every Tuesday there were weekly meetings to discuss the project. This helped with agreeing items & and issues were dealt with on the spot. 5) A full account has been drawn up that doesn’t cover full costs. 1) Ensure we have adequate time to tender in order to produce an adequate tender to submit. 2) In future, we should take time to review and highlight any areas of concern/ lack of information – this is to avoid any quick starts on future projects. 3) Identify items when they occur and then discuss / agree when this does happen. 4) These were meetings that the client insisted on us having & worked out very well in regards discussing the several items that needed to be clarified etc. 5) The projects client is a developer and interested in keeping the profit margin. This highlights the fact that we ought to know who our client is and possibly not have a developer as a client in future."
1) No NCR’s were being raised .1) There have been some quality issues on this contract that did not use the JMS NCR procedure to try and sort out. NCR’s are now known as Quality Observation – this is to prevent any negative thoughts about raising an observation and now is required to raise 2 QOB’s per 1M turnover.
"1) No incidents or accidents occurred on this high risk project. 2) We constructed our own welfare services in the back garden which incorporated a site office, canteen, changing room, male & female toilets. We had to do this because bringing in site cabins would have been unfeasible. 1) Continue to raise the zero harm culture with all site operatives. 2) This worked very well considering the space we had for our site set-up and site-storage was very limited."
1) Smartwaste was updated on a weekly basis by the site manager 2) 98% waste diverted from landfill. 1) Continue to use smartwaste & get the site managers to update on a regular basis. 2) Continue to divert as much waste as possible from landfill.
"1) Despite organising a broadband line to be installed on this project, BT installed the box incorrectly in the building, which is the building site. Unfortunately, we have been able to get the box moved into the cabins we built in the back so had to use a router attached a dongle & a printer. 2) O2 reception was poor at all times in the area – the dongle was changed to a Vodaphone sim card to pick up signal, but all mobile phones barely picked up any reception and frequently cut-out causing communication problems. 1) This is unacceptable and on future projects, we will not have a temporary router connection on a project that requires broadband. 2) On future contracts, insist an IT technician calls to site and carry out a full survey of site to determine our IT needs and what will work best for the site."
"1) The tender programme for this project was for 18no. weeks, which was not realistic. We still had to work to the programme, but due to extra works & record keeping, we were successful in receiving EOT. 2) Surveys were started later than we’d liked to. Due to finding another door supplier/ sub[1]contractor who have the Qmark registration & was more reasonable priced. Door surveys actually commenced in June, but were programmed in May. 3) It took some time to carry out surveys to identify glazing, louvers, fire stopping, & general carpentry. There was some asbestos removal due to instructions. Instructions from the client were like peace[1]meal instead of having a definitive list. 4) Making appointments for installing doors was smooth with minimal disruption. 5) Communication was poor at first but towards the end on the contract, due toproactive nature of JMS staff, we managed to complete the contract & received information. 1) If we go for projects in future with a tight deadline, we are to focus on excellent record keeping (i.e. CVI’s, TQ’s etc) to see if we can apply for any EOT’s. 2) In doing so, the contract was able to make profit. The decision to look for a new subcontractor in addition to the two named subcontractors in the contract (which the client was insisting we use) created a competitive tendering environment which enabled us to negotiate better rates from the named subcontractors. 3) Towards end of contract, some areas of works were not yet complete. In future contracts, we should push the client for a definitive list instead of agreeing to receiving instructions in a peace-meal method. 4) Our RLO’s have been very productive & managed appointments very well. 5) Ensure that we always try and work on improving communication with all sub[1]contractors, project team & client"
1) Good site set-up 2) We had to stop carrying out inspections periods as there were too much snags being found. 1) The site set-up was planned out by the Site Managers with our Contracts Manager prior to site possession & was carefully thought out in order for all residents to have easy access to. 2) Foreman & the site managers became more proactive to get the doors inspected & signed off by the client.
"We had minimal control over design responsibilities which only included the metal intake doors, scaffold & louvers."
The only temporary works that was carried out was the scaffolding.
"1) New staff started on probabtion – Staff started in January and the works commenced in June, The probation periods were then extended to December which didn’t help as the staff were unsettled and production affected quite difficult on this project. 2) Site Manager who started at a later date in October was very proactive and managed to complete the project despite facing difficulties on the project. 1) In future, JMS are to look into agency staff for upcoming projects to avoid repeating the same problem. 2) Continue to motivate & encourage all permanent staff to work pro-actively in order to complete a successful project."
1) Plant hired from Elliot such as containers and toilets were managed well & off hired very efficiently. 1) Inform both plant & buying dept of how efficient Elliot were on this project.
"1) Lead times for LFS to order the doors varieddepending on door type and have a minimum of 4 weeks to be delivered. 2) Gunfire – We had to check their works i.e. metal doors as there was a slight uncertainty with the type of metal doors to be installed. It took time to complete the installation but did well in other areas of their works. 3) NLC – installation of louvers took time. 4) Hardle – They performed very well on this contract. 1) As we were aware of the lead times, we carried out door surveys 2 months before & organised a comprehensive program for the door installations which had the lead times for doors into account. 2) Ensure that our site foreman & Site managers always check the completed works of a sub-contractor prior to offering it to the client to inspect & approve works. 3) See above comment regarding Sub[1]contractors 4) Inform Buying Dept of their performance."
- See above section for Materials for comments.
"1) We initially tendered with no prelims 2) Due to change of personnel, some information was lost/ mislaid but due to JMS proactive approach to complete works we managed to have a complete turnaround. 3) Final account for P1 is almost complete & there are some areas in P2 to be complete – All sub-contractors have been paid. 1) The project was priced very competitively in order to secure the works with a view to maximising profitability on the project variations, the likelihood of which were assessed at estimating stage. 2) As mentioned earlier, we will be looking into agency staff in future specifically for projects if we need to in order to prevent this occurring again. 3) The Project QS organises all payments and will complete the final accounts once all works have been complete."
"1) No NCR’s were raised despite some problems did occur on site 2) We have had 2no. internal audits & 1no. BM Trada re-cert audit on this contract 3) The handover process worked well despite having to deal with1700 doors & making appointments with COW, RLO & SM. 4) Good record keeping"
1) Good welfare services installed & provided for the site operatives & staff. 1) Continue to provide adequate welfare services for all site operatives and staff for the project.
"1) Smartwaste was not being completed on site – This was set-up being done initially, but once the works were progressing rapidly, records were not being inserted. 1) Contracts Manager to inform all site mangers the importance of inserting waste records onto smartwaste – The Q&E advisor is willing to organise another TBT should they require."
"1) IT – Despite problems initially were the contract period was vague, we did not organise broadband on site. Due to the contract having more & more works being included, the length of contract increased & agreed to organise broadband on site. 1) O2 dongles were being used initially but the reception is quite poor and slow – IT however did organise the broadband to site very quickly."
"1) Due to lack of information from client, both progress & programme was affected as we had to keep pressing for information. 2) JMS did not have much input with programme as it was given by the client. We were given 16 weeks to complete all contractual works due to school term times. 3) To meet contract deadline, site team, including Site Manager, had to work over 5no. weekends & Bank Holiday. This was due to late instructions & some unforeseen works once commencing works. 4) Key dates slipped for reasons including procurement of specialist contractors, client information and co-ordination of works. 1) At tender stage, areas which were unclear should be highlighted. Once contract has been awarded, areas which are unclear can be actioned by Site Manager prior to commencing works to site. 2) We did not have any control of works as it was programmed in during a busy period. In future, JMS should be more firm to agree to a realistic programme with the client and let subcontractors know of repercussions if their works do not complete their works on time. 3) In future, we should programme the works with some slippage time & be in control of it as we may have at the time. 4) The programme should be monitored daily and progress reported accurately."
1) Site office layout was suitable for the works being carried out on site. 2) Site compound had to be located in a different location to tender location in order to carry out the works safely in school environment. The compound was further away from the works area resulting in additional time to transport materials 3) Blockwork. Poor quality and incorrect details were picked up to late and led to delays. 1) On all projects we ensure that the site compound layout is appropriate for the project. 2) Input from delivery team required at tender stage to determine how the works will be executed. 3) Ensure sub contractors are monitored for quality and compliance with specification.
"1) Not enough detail in certain design elements or not tallying up to what was actually on site causing delays as requests for clarifications were required. 2) Due to changes in some design areas, there was more room for variations. 1) At tender stage, we should make note of the drawings/ scope of works that require more information/ detail in order to raise TQ’s as soon as possible once we get to site. 2) Ensure that once changes are made, keep record of delays etc"
1) Hoarding & Harris fencing design was agreed on prior to works commencing on site. 1) Ensure we keep doing this for all projects.
"1) Some delays to CRB checks & more people on site should’ve had one. 2) Site Manager felt there was too much paperwork for him to cope with on site as more supervision on site was required by him on this contract due to the nature of works. 3) We had a short leading period on this contract, using our own JMS labour enabled us to commence almost immediately. 4) Inefficient use of our direct labour at times causing poor interims of production. 1) When we have contracts in schools, we should ensure that prior to allocating staff & labour, we should have them CRB checked. 2) Another Site supervisor was allocated to site to help Site Manager with paperwork . 3) Using JMS labour gives us some flexibility & control to undertake contracts that have small portions of work packages in one contract. 4) In future, we should be more selective on the type of projects we tender for. Should we decide to go for more projects of this nature, we should adjust the rates accordingly. If we use direct labour in future, we need to agree beforehand the level of labour which will be required & the time it takes to complete, including the plant &equipment."
"1) External Plant hire process was very efficient. 2) We need to agree prior to works commencing, what plant has been allowed for in the estimate. On this project we underestimated what plant was required on site causing us to go over budget. 1) Ensure we keep using the external plant hire process as it is working efficiently. 2) We need to have a mutually agreed plan and maybe discuss plant on site in order to minimise hiring periods."
1) Materials were ordered too late & became cost effective as JMS labour then went to collect items. This then meant that some items were not ordered to the correct quantity & some surplus materials. 1) Material procurement schedule needs to be drawn up to agree quantities etc.
"1) The subcontractors that worked on the plumbing, electrics, tiles, window installation & the entrance canopy were all good subcontractors to work with & completed the works at a high standard. 2) The floor laying subcontractor & brick layers were not efficient and we had many problems with them. 3) The subcontractors were not appointed at the start of contract due to late allocation of QS 4) All subcontractors were ‘busy’ as works progressed during the holiday period. 1) Make note of these subcontractors and inform the buying/ sub-contract department of their performance for future use. 2) Make note of these subcontractors and inform the buying/ sub-contract department of their performance for future use. 3) Ensure that once contract has been awarded, we allocate QS. 4) We need to draw up a programme for subcontractors and have a commencement period – these needs to be enforced. We also need to ensure that we are ready for the subcontractors to start their works straight away. Lead in periods for notification of contractors to commence works to be agreed. Notification to be made in writing."
"1) Due to small preliminary budget in tender, staff costs, running plant, sundries & welfare were not included. 1) We need to make realistic allowances within tenders & agree how we will be completing the job."
"1) No NCR’s were raised when there were issues with floor laying or bricklaying subcontractor. 2) Overall, site records were well kept & the TQ’s were written as soon as matter rose along with CVI’s. 1) Ensure that site managers raise NCR’s when issue’s with subcontractors occur 2) Ensure we maintain good record keeping on all our future contracts."
"1) Due to the nature of works in a school, we had to restrict delivery times to suit school opening hours. 1) This worked well & we had no problems with this agreement."
"1) Squirrel issue was not highlighted prior to works & was discovered once the plumbing contractor started works to the loft. 1) Ask client if no ecological report produced, if they had any problems with animals in the past."
"1) Due to Site Manager working off a 3G dongle, the intranet, e_x0002_mails & access to the F; Drive was poor. 2) Printer damage was never resolved & Apogee took it away at the end of the contract to repair – Not when it was reported. 1) Find out from IT if there is a better alternative to resolve this issue. 2) Ensure that once damage has been highlighted, site manager is to inform IT dept along with Q&E advisor & their contracts manager so they can speak to IT to chase Apogee."
"Project Completed 3 weeks late with EoT granted. Slow start to project due to late procurement of sub contractors and QS resource. EoT granted due to inadequate client information requested at an early stage in the project. Ensure procurement schedule in place, adhered to and resources available to implement."
"Site set up. Works spread widely around a four mile reservoir with a one way system in place and speed restrictions. Adequate for the works, adapting existing facilities to reduce costs. Planning of works and logistics reduced travel time and increased efficiency."
Late production of M&E design due to late appointment of specialist contractors. Delayed production of drainage design. Ensure contractors appointed in line with procurement schedule and design responsibility made clear with allowance for additional lead in time. No allowance made for drainage design in tender and the need for specialist design was not communicated.
Temporary works .Excavations battered back.
Agency labour .Used labour agency for the majority of non sub contractor works with inclusion for transport to and from site. Reduced costs of transporting JMS labour to Oxford daily.
Hired plant from an external hire company local to the area. Improved maintenance response and reduced cost of delivery/collection of plant
Ready Mixed concrete. Cotswold stone. Took a long time to place an order with a local plant. Buying slow to respond Long lead in time not fully taken into account and caused a delay to the operation
Procurement. Location of works. Late procurement delayed an already tight programme. Only avoided being penalised due to client inadequacies in other areas. Due to distance of works from London it proved difficult to get sub contractors on system interested in pricing.
Extension of Time. Estimating. Granted due to good communication with client and early production of technical queries. Ensure estimating procedure followed including meetings with operations side to determine how best to execute the works taking into account location. To obtain firm prices from sub contractors at tender stage.
Minimal defects at handover. No defects at end of 12 month defects period. Effective management of operations and understanding of client needs. As above.
Traffic management. Managed effectively considering high risk of reservoir being used daily by sailing clubs and fishing clubs and proximity of works to members of the public around a four mile reservoir with one way system . No accidents Safe systems of work produced well ahead of operations
"No incidents . Effective management of site considering the sensitive nature of works adjacent to the reservoir, works in a forest and adjacent to streams."
Thames Water Permits to work . System managed well and did not delay any operations.
"1) Lack of information from the client – Thames Water was not able to provide any info, surveys or drawings for the drainage, shower & toilet thus causing delays 2) Whilst breaking out concrete for the drainage, it was discovered that the concrete had 12mm shingles & 18/ 16/ 12mm metal rebar’s (excessive re-enforcement). – This was unforeseen and not standard construction techniques. 3) Asbestos was discovered whilst exposing drainage pipes in the concrete. 1) When job is granted, we need to make sure that we have all the relevant information & drawings for the scope of works. This is to be highlighted at tender stage & passed onto the allocated project team. 2) Issues were communicated to the client and the required additional time and cost added to the contract 3) Asbestos was contained in accordance to regs with no problems."
1) The site set-up was very straight forward & very well done. 1) Ensure we think about out site set-up on all future projects.
1) The client issued late instructions to the scope of M&E works on the project. JMS re[1]programmed the works to limit the additional time to the contract. 2) JMS had to involve Building Control in regards to the drainage works to discuss works & for it to be certified etc. JMS also used this opportunity to discuss the method of tying into existing drainage & if this would be certified. 1) Continue to work with the clients to achieve their contract objectives whilst ensuring JMS has a reasonable period to complete the additional works. 2) Time & money was saved by adapting the joins in the plumbing works to offer the client best value for money.
There was not much Temporary works on site other than the Harris Fencing.
1) The QS & site manager was not allocated to this contract with an adequate leading time with the works involved due to the site manager being involved in active projects. QS was also allocated to this contract late due to overall workloads of the QS as a whole during holiday period. 1) Staff allocation for projects should be organised once the contract has been awarded.
1) Plant was readily available & maintained well.
"1) Communication between Buyers & Building dept is poor. 2) The lead times to ordering materials was affected due to late allocation of site manager & QS which led to material reqs being given to buying dept without an adequate lead time whilst still requiring an urgent turn around to get the materials on site to prevent further delays. 3) The change in procurement procedure within JMS for giving the buyer a minimum of 5no. working days on contracts like Riverside don’t seem to work well on site as it can cause further delays. 1) If problems occur on a material requisition order, the buyer should inform Site Manager and/or QS to discuss resolution. 2) In future, once the contract has been awarded & staff has been allocated, a procurement schedule should be drawn up for the contract. 3) The nature of this contract requires more pro-active and collaborative approach from both buying & building departments in order to achieve the contract objectives."
1) Sub-contractors orders were placed later than required due to late allocation of project QS. 2) The QS sent out the subcontractor packages and carried out the tender analysis in agreement with the buyer to limit the delays. 3) John Gregory labourers were efficient & reliable in carrying out their duties. 1) A QS should be assigned to a project as soon as the contract has been awarded. 2) Having pro-active staff is always great but we need to ensure that we allocate staff at the correct time of the commencement of a project in order to avoid a rush. 3) We should inform buying dept of the sub[1]contractors that performed well & the sub[1]contractors that didn’t do too well.
"1) There was a lack of info within the scope of works which should have been highlighted at tender stage. 2) Administration of change control was managed according to JMS procedures which all parties were happy to use. 1) Once contract has been awarded, staff assigned to the contract should have a meeting with the estimator to go over contract & any areas that the site manager should be aware of prior to commencing works to site. 2) Ensure we continue to use JMS procedures."
1) Records were kept well on site.
"1) The toilet, changing room & canteen eco block does not make sense in regards to waste removal if there are more than 10no. persons on site as there was only a 250G water tank. 1) Give feedback to Plant Dept."
1) Waste tickets were not inputted into smartwaste. 1) Ensure ALL projects enter their waste data onto smartwaste.
1) The site manager was experiencing a few problems with the printer on site & found leaving site to call over to KTY no practical. 1) Give feedback to IT dept.
"1) Programme was too tight & weather was not taken into consideration or with any time for any slippage. The 9 week programme in the end became a 12 week programme. 2) There was a short lead time prior to contract starting. Due to this, the Site Manager did not have enough time to prepare, organise materials or discuss the scope of works. 3) Contract is the first time JMS Building has ever worked for another JMS dept, Water & Waste Water. 1) Agree a programme with client in order to achieve a flexible/ realistic programme. 2) Prior to works commencing on site, a meeting with QS, buyer & Site Manager should be held in order to discuss materials/procurement on site. 3) Works were completed under a unique & difficult circumstance. A good working relationship was built with Southern Water (Client), Site engineer & Site foreman."
"1) Site Manager worked well with Site engineer to carry out the setting out 2) Due to errors being identified, the principal contractor had to action which caused disruptions and delays for our works to be carried out. 1) This gave the Site manager a chance to familiarise with the scope of works & identifying errors at an early stage for the Principal Contractor to action. 2) Principal contractor actioned the errors."
"1) Quality of drawings issued to us at tender stage has considerably changed when we were ready to start works thus causing us to re-price the project due to changes. 1) In future, if we get another job of this nature within another JMS business unit, we should qualify our price in agreement with client."
Not in our scope of works. Water & Waste Water business unit were responsible for the temporary works on site.
1) Only Graham Jackson on site. 1) We did not require a site-based QS on site.
1) External plant hire process (David Wilson) was good – All plant came with correct certs & test results. 1) Inform Plant Dept of good plant sub[1]contractor for future JMS job.
"1) Communication between Building & Buying Dept was not adequate. 2) Stock taking was in place in order to identify problems with brick & block mis[1]match 1) In future, we should have a meeting with contract buyer prior to commencing contract works to discuss procurement & supply chain. 2) This enabled the site manager to continue works whilst sourcing blockwork of the same colour in order to complete the pumping station shell."
"1) Brickwork sub[1]contractor operatives were note sufficiently motivated for the works to be carried out due to various issues including the weather, type of brick specified, costs, etc 2) The Roofing contractor & joinery firm were very good and accommodating 1) During procurement process, we need to have a more rigorous vetting process with sub-contractors. They need to be qualified & experienced to do their job and also understand that they need to buy into JMS work ethos on site 2) We built a good working relationship with them and we may want to use them again for future contracts."
"1) We were being treated as a sub-contractor & not as a JMS team. As variations were raised, they were not agreed & given no explanation why. 2) Final account has yet to be agreed despite our contract works being complete. 1) In future, should we be a subcontractor to another JMS dept, we should be more formal from start, to finish. 2) We are to organise a meeting to discuss/agree the final account."
1) Quality records have been recorded well & maintained by the site manager to provide any evidence or information as of when required 2) No Non-conformances have been raised when problems occurred with a subcontractor orsupplier.  1) Ensure that we maintain records at all times on all out projects. 2) Quality Advisor to give a TBT to all site managers for future projects.
Not in our scope of works .We were a subcontractor to the Water & Waste Water business unit.
Not in our scope of works. We were a subcontractor to the Water & Waste Water business unit
"1) Contract was programmed well & completed on time. 2) EOT could’ve been extended as extra works were being added with client instructions, but due to the proactive nature of the site team, works were completed within the bare minimum time frame. 3) Due to some orders for sub[1]contractors not being processed in buying dept within the lead period, we had to work out of sequence. 1) Make sure all future projects are programmed well. 2) Ensure that site team are kept motivated in order to maintain their proactive approach to complete works. 3) Orders are to be processed by the buyer once it is placed within the leading time period. Buyer is then to confirm that the order is placed."
"1) Contract was programmed well & completed on time. 2) EOT could’ve been extended as extra works were being added with client instructions, but due to the proactive nature of the site team, works were completed within the bare minimum time frame. 3) Due to some orders for sub[1]contractors not being processed in buying dept within the lead period, we had to work out of sequence. 1) Make sure all future projects are programmed well. 2) Ensure that site team are kept motivated in order to maintain their proactive approach to complete works. 3) Orders are to be processed by the buyer once it is placed within the leading time period. Buyer is then to confirm that the order is placed."
"1) There were a few issues with the M&E design portion due to the size of project. 2) We discussed the changes of the specifications to the windows with the client and saved money which benefitted the contract via QS procuring. 1) When procuring a subcontractor for M&E, they are to cover the design package on project & supply drawings - even if they can annotate the existing drawings. 2) On certain design elements within projects, we should always discuss with the client to see if we can get a better deal which will benefit the contract."
We didn’t have much temporary works on this contract other than the scaffold & Harris fencing.
1) We had sufficient staff & labour on this contract 2) Training courses were booked accordingly for staff/ labour development and also benefitted the project i.e. the culture change programme. 1) Ensure that we continue to resource sufficient staff & labour on this contract. 2) Continue to book relevant training courses where necessary & appropriate.
"1) We had a few problems getting the generator down to set-up power on site due to electricians not showing up when asked etc. After speaking to Dave Murphy, we were able to organise the generator for the electricians for site & set-up. 2) Apogee printer was not collected on time even though enough time was given to IT to notify them to collect the printer. 3) There has been some difficulty to remove both Internal & external plant off the system. 1) We need to establish an agreement with the electricians in order to organise site set-ups etc 2) Ensure that IT dept is informed of the delays. 3) We need to establish how & why these items have not been removed – speak to Plant Dept."
"1) There were some significant difficulties in purchasing materials due to invoices not being paid – In order to prevent delays, the Site Manager started to buy materials for the project, as certain suppliers were on stop with JMS. 2) Specified items by the client, Thames Water, were from Screwfix, however, JMS does not have an account with them. So our Site Manager bought the items in the interest of completing the project. 3) Despite experiencing possible major problems with ordering materials on site, the site manager was working very proactively in order to purchase the materials with his own money to successfully complete the project. 1) We need to find out why suppliers are being stopped as this causes unnecessary inconvenience to projects no matter how pro-active the site manager is. 2) We, JMS should consider having an account with Screwfix. 3) This may not have been the correct procedure, but the project was completed very successfully with very satisfied clients."
1) We should involve the buyer more in regards to some meetings. 2) The plastering firm FPL had a poor performing team on site – they were very unreliable with their attendance on site. 1) This will allow the buyer to have some understanding of the contract requirements etc. 2) Let Buying Dept know.
1) We made a profit on this contract. 2) We spent a lot more on the preliminaries then we allowed for on the project. 3) The specification issued to JMS was quite loose and not specific thus causing delays as the client were not sure what they wanted. 4) CVI’s & TQ’s were kept well on site. 1) Continue to make profit on contracts 2) We need to be more selective and agree on what projects we are pricing. 3) JMS should maybe qualify what is priced with the client 4) Continue to use CVI’s & TQ’s.
1) Site records & site diary were kept very well 2) No NCR’s have been raised 1) Continue to keep good records on site for all projects. 2) Speak to site managers & explain to them to use the NCR procedure when they are experiencing any non[1]conformance on site.
1) Well done site set-up – Site offices & Welfare facilities. 1) Continue to put thought into site-set ups.
1) SmartWaste was being used on site to record waste data 1) Ensure that all site managers use SmartWaste & understand the importance of recording waste data via this tool.
1) There were some problems with internet connections on site as the o2 dongles were simply not picking up any signal. 1) IT took the dongles away & orgainised a 3G router from Speedy to use on site. The signal was poor but it was better than nothing.
"Project over ran by four weeks. Extension of time with costs granted. Good document control, communication and reporting enabled speedy agreement."
"Site set up. 2no site set ups were required and proved adequate for the works. Access for roofing and external works to high rise blocks. Scaffolding was used for accessing external works and hoists used for the transportation of materials. Alternative means of access were considered such as mast climbers but discounted further to review of practicalities and requirements for each block. Early planning and negotiation with client was required to secure appropriate locations where parking for residents at a premium. Careful planning, investigation and selection of the appropriate means of access when working at heights. Many alternatives available."
Window installers provided adequate design solutions Engage specialist contractors to provide added value.
Scaffolding. Scaffolding was managed under group temporary works procedures. To implement temporary works controls from the outset.
Staff. Planned staffing for two locations proved adequate. Client and residents expressed high satisfaction with the team. Particular praise from the client for the Site Manager and his proactive approach. Agency Labour. Carpenters were requested to carry out some specific operations. Operatives who arrived to site were not suitable for operation and sent away. HSQE Support. Regular H&S inspections carried out. Environmental and Quality support limited. Assessment of resource requirements to be accurately considered at tender stage. Proactive approach is well received by client. Importance of identifying specific requirements and subsequent vetting to ensure suitability. Further departmental resource required.
Goods Hoists. Good service from hoist provider. Planthire. Feedback to procurement.
Minimal wastage. Accurate assessment and ordering of materials resulted in minimal wastage.
Procurement. Good buying gains made on tender price on some sub contractor packages. Contractor into liquidation. One window fabrications and installations contractor went into liquidation during the project. Fortunately occurred at the end of the project so the impacts were limited on site with minimal works having to be carried out by JMS. May impact during defect period. Detailed procurement led by project commercial team in collaboration with buying dept. Project Commercial team have detailed knowledge of certain specialist packages and should works together with the buying department to ensure best value. Ensure adequate checks are carried out on all sub contractors.
"Tender submission and acceptance. Tender submission was good. Client appointed JMS outside of the tender acceptance period. JMS had to consider implications with regard tender price and client relationship prior to agreeing. Negotiations prior to accepting enabled scope for value engineering. Value engineering. Client agreed to the value engineering of certain specified elements resulting in further buying gains for JMS. Through good communication and demonstration of previous experience, we managed to dissuade the client from instructing upon some provisional sum items that would be less beneficial to JMS commercially. Change control management. Good use of CVI’s/TQ’s aided the appropriate identification, costing and agreement of variations. Careful consideration of risk and opportunities available when making a strategic decision. Value engineering can provide considerable commercial gains to both client and JMS. Consider and propose alternatives to specification. Whole Project team should be fully aware of JMS commercial position with regard work elements. Accurate recording of change and outstanding information via CVI’s and TQ’s can aid with securing full value on variations and substantiation for extension of time claims."
Minimal defects at handover. No quality observations made. Effective management of operations and understanding of client needs. Consider if quality observations were missed and subsequently the opportunity to learn from mistakes.
Site set up and welfare proved adequate. 1no accident. No LTI’s. Pre planning and consideration of office and welfare requirements. Safe systems of work implemented and managed for some high risk activities.
Site IT. Use of dongles limits abilities and particularly use of the f:drive Ensure adequate IT/internet access is available to all sites. Investigate solutions available.
Programme effectively started in delay due to need for additional procurement time for large packages(scaffolding and roofing) as a result of minimal contractors with the ability to complete the works and cost. Despite the initial delay an EoT of 8 weeks is agreed in principal with no penalties. When obtaining prices from contractors at tender stage consideration needs to be given on their ability and appetite to execute the works in the current competitive climate. Effective communication with the client and recording of delays and variations enabled agreement.
Access scaffolding and temporary roofs. Carried out investigative works/sample roof to one of the larger blocks due to proximity to the compound. Alternative means of access for elements of working at height were investigated. Access scaffolding was selected for all and worked well. Temporary roofs were priced in tender and provided enabling continuity of roofing works and no delays due to inclement weather of leaks to occupied properties. It would have been beneficial to programme if the smallest block had been selected.
"Roof venting. Change from asphalt to liquid plastic gutters. Researched the extent of ventilation required to the roofs and succeeded in influencing the specification with reduction in vents and subsequent value engineering. Specification asked for the removal and renewal of asphalt gutters. JMS proposed use of alternative material that could overlay the exiting gutters. Saved on costs, waste and removed a fire hazard."
"Scaffolding and temporary roofs. Extensive scaffolding and large temporary roofs required temporary works designs. Group procedures followed, no observations from DNV audit."
"Employed Site Manager. Staff levels. In house labour. Agency Resident Liaison Officers were used on occasion. Despite good people skills, the level of paperwork skills proved inadequate and was not determined until it was too late. A Site Manager was employed prior to project commencement but resigned within 4 weeks of start on site. Endeavour to fully assess commitment during recruitment stage. Potential risk with new employees. Managed to employ suitable replacement within the following 4 weeks who benefited the project. Adequate commercial and production staff. Resident Liaison supplemented with agency support when required. Carried out carpentry, drainage and maintenance works with in house labour. Enabled cost effective execution of works whilst providing adequate maintenance and housekeeping provision. Particularly good standard of works and production from carpenters. Determine and measure skill set required for agency staff. To be assessed and managed on site to determine suitability."
Hire electrical tools from JMS is not cost effective. Goods hoists used for transport of materials and debris and suited the site environment and requirements. Hoists supplied by scaffolding contractor. Hoist did break down on occasion. Various items of electrical equipment were hired in house. This is not cost effective in the long term and business units should have the ability to purchase and manage tools that are used repeatedly. Correct selection of plant. We usually hire from an external provider but provision by the scaffolders proved to be cost effective and reduced the risk with regard breakdowns delaying the scafflolders and subsequent waiting time. Less co-ordination of trades. Feedback to supplier. Agree upon acceptable call out response prior to award.
Assessed quantities required as early as practicable and bulk ordered Reduced collections and improved buying
Procurement. Tested the market well and got very good value of sizable packages. The two main sub contractors performed well. Contractor progress meetings. Commercial and procurement teams working together effectively. Roofing and scaffolding contractors performed well considering the extent of work required in programmed period. Contractor progress meetings enabled effective monitoring of contractor productivity in lien with programme.
"Misinterpretation of communication led to the electrical contractor(from approved client list) carrying out extensive works to communal boards without a clear and concise instruction. Contractor had a previous working relationship with the client and followed a process previously used on other contracts. However, the clients rep has since questioned the interpretation and subsequently we are in negotiation to resolve. Variations. Do not proceed with works until an instruction is received and is clear and concise, describing fully the extent of works. To be followed up with a CVI or TQ if there is any ambiguity or need for clarification. All other variations/instructions followed process and have been agreed."
On the whole good standard of work meeting client requirements .Standard of works has been commended. Agreement of pilot/sample areas enabled effective control of measuring of quality. I&TP’s in place.
1no LTI accident. PPE. Too much management of sub contractors was required initially with regard adherence to PPE. Improved upon escalation. Despite the necessary scaffold inspections being carried out regularly and by competent persons(Scaffolding sub contractor) an operative injured themselves by falling from a ladder. Ensure inspections and records maintained as legislation. Recommend use of scaffolding sub contractor for inspections to reduce risk of inadequate inspections resulting in injuries to persons and potential prosecution/claims upon JMS. Ensure adequate communication of requirements pre contract award and potential penalties for non compliance.
"All waste segregated with timber, rubble and general waste skips .Effective of stripping activities and logistically withy regard skips enabled the segregation of waste despite some site constraints. It was questioned if we are getting value for the timber skips? Doesn’t appear to be a great saving."
Eleven Sectional completions were identified in the contract and all were met. Practical completion achieved one week ahead of programme. Client attempted to pressurise JMS into agreeing shorter lead in time. Negotiated a two week extension to project commencement. Effective management of the programme and co[1]ordination of works. Maintain position with regard required lead in period.
"Planning of site set up around car park construction enabled early commencement of end critical path activities and benefited programme. Modular buildings were selected for some classrooms ahead of traditional build. Reduced on site resource pressures on JMS and exposure to associated risks. Commercially beneficial. Required additional planning and logistical challenges. Changed construction of staffroom extension from SIP panels to on site timber frame construction. Enabled works to be carried out in house and benefited programme due to access challenges. Regular client, contractor and consultant inspections resulted in limited snags and efficient handover. Importance of planning site set up around work activities. Different construction options were carefully considered and selected further to risk and opportunity assessment. Different construction options were carefully considered and selected further to risk and opportunity assessment."
Employed a consultant for structural and architectural design improving co-ordination of design and commercial gains. Stringent client design acceptance process was well controlled and all approvals were in line with programme. Effective selection of specialist consultants and consideration of project needs. Management and control of the design acceptance process.
Site manager proposed an alternative temporary works solution to the structural engineer resulting in time and cost saving. Sharing and contribution of ideas.
"Staff. Site Managers first project, gained valuable experience and performed to a very high level. In house labour. Completed the works using an extensive amount of in house labour due to nature and programme of works. In particular flexibility of B/U operatives. No Design co[1]ordinator/manager in B/U. HSQE Support. Regular H&S, Environmental and Quality support limited. Effective development of staff. In house resource was of particular benefit to this project. Extent required to be considered early. This resource would have benefited the B/U and reduced pressure on the team. Further departmental resource required."
In general in house plant utilised. Generally positive service.
Rockpanel cladding. Client requested a non standard colour of cladding. At time of ordering site enquired about the lead in time from the supplier(SIG). SIG advised of two week lead in. It transpired latterly that the lead in period was in fact 6-8 weeks. If the team was aware of this prior to order then they could have advised the client and an alternative colour could have been considered based upon programme pressures. Accurate provision of information from suppliers. Early communication of any material lead in periods can allow the consideration of alternative products.
Sub contractors generally performed well. Use of new sub-contractors will add to JMS supply chain.
"Good tender with extensive ability to value engineer. Gains achieved on consultants and alternative materials. Procurement of consultants did not commence until after contract award. Design acceptance well managed with no delays. Change control management. Good use of CVI’s/TQ’s aided the appropriate identification, costing and agreement of variations that resulted from changing client requirements. Value engineering can provide considerable commercial gains to both client and JMS. Consider and propose alternatives to specification. This put extensive pressure on the team with regard the appointment of consultants and lead in period. For D&B projects in particular it would be beneficial to have engaged designers at tender stage and upon contract award be in a position to appoint immediately. Important to control the design acceptance process to reduce risk of programme delays or non[1]conformances. Accurate recording of change and outstanding information via CVI’s and TQ’s can aid with securing full value on variations."
No quality observations made. Consider if quality observations were missed and subsequently the opportunity to learn from mistakes.
Site set up and welfare proved adequate. 1no minor accident. No LTI’s. Pre planning and consideration of office and welfare requirements. Safe systems of work implemented and managed.
Site IT. Use of dongles limits abilities and particularly use of the f:drive Ensure adequate IT/internet access is available to all sites. Investigate solutions available.
"Tender Programme. Site security Method of work Surveying & Setting out Office and site set up. Not enough time allowed in the programme for certain activities e.g. HV trench (5 days allowed, 15 days to complete) AFC’s were issued very close to start date which didn’t allow review against time allowed in programme. Job completed on time as per the programme with increase in recourses. Three week look ahead submitted to the Client on a weekly basis. Weekly progress meetings with the Client discussing any issues that came up during the project. CCTV cameras were installed in the welfare area/site compound. Saving costs of a site security guard. This also reduced the risk of Lone working, fuel usage (lowering co2 emissions). Utilised GRP shoring to carryout UTX works reducing the need for plant to be lifting conventional steel shores. Use of on-track gators to facilate cable pulling and troughing works. Use of in-house engineering and surveying teams to conduct all setting out requirements onsite. As this job was planned to take place over a number of weeks, adequate welfare units were sourced and provided by the Client. This included a place for the site team to eat with hot and cold running water, toilets for male and female and a drying room for overnight storage of PPE. Extra welfare was also provided when requested due to the increase of recourses for possessions. Good site layout with adequate room for storage and good segregated walking routes to reduce the risk of plan people interface."
Commissioning & Testing .All ITP’s followed and records of inspections completed and signed off by the Client as works progressed.
"Purchasing Lead times Design Change, Design Review Drawing Control Lack of communication between the procurement department and the project team. Northern Waste are supporting S1 Minor Works on procurement. This causes further confusion regarding GRN of waste tickets, dockets and invoices. Clarity required moving forward. There does not appear to be a designated specific waste service in Procurement for the South. GRP troughing 3 month lead times. Items had to be sourced outside the UK which resulted in rescheduling and re-arranging of works. Client CRE onsite which enabled good communications regarding any minor design questions or changes Amey designer based in Spain which was a communication challenge. Drawings managed well with a revision register kept up to date and superseded drawing kept in a separated folder."
Management of subcontract designers (including communication) .Early engagement with RMD for solution using shuttering pans for retaining wall with safe access and guarding for working at height.
"Labour Subcontractors Competence, Training, Experience .The day to day running of the project was carried out efficiently by an experienced, multi skilled JMS site team. Combination of JMS and labour only sub-contractors worked well as a team. The site team provided very positive feedback on the sub-contractors that carried out the form work and steel fixing. They were a very experienced team and were very efficient, worked as part of a team and carried a very neat job out within the programme deadlines and contributed to a well finished quality job."
Hire / Off-hire Maintenance / certification Havwear (used to monitor and control individual exposure to HAVS) Track Mats Good communication between the site team and the plant department at Kentish Town resulted in no plant or equipment issues All plant and equipment requirements were coordinated well and of satisfactory standard Havwear (equipment to manage and monitor the risk posed by hand arm vibration) was introduced to this Bulls Lodge on the early stages of the roll out and introduction of the new monitoring system with the P & T department. SHESQ advisor briefed the team and gave them guidance on the Hav watches/ The RFID cards were also brought to site in March. There were approx. 17 JMS personnel that were introduced and utilised the new system. Plastic track mats used on access road to prevent damage and spread the load of heavy vehicles travelling over the culvert.
"Suppliers Client Procurement procedures .Due to high demand for GRP troughing on other rail projects across the UK delays were experienced. Good communication between the site team and the suppliers resulted in reduced issues with our internal procurement dept. Due to the Clients poor procurement process JMS were tasked with purchasing items that should be supplied by the PC. (first aid kits, fire equipment, welfare provisions)."
"Management / supervision of (including communication) Competence & Experience Training records for Sub contractors Subcontract labour “Blara” were used to supplement JMS labour on weekends whereby possessions were booked to aid JMS labour on completion of works on timescales and target, in addition subcontractors were sourced to complete works were certain specific skills were required to fulfill the works . The site team provided very positive feedback on the sub-contractors that carried out the works. They were a very experienced team and were very efficient. They also worked well as part of a team. Training records were not provided to JMS for all subcontractors prior to commencing works onsite. This resulted in time spent chasing information."
Records / Handover .Project handed over in line with the programme. Information for the Health and safety file passed onto the Client for completion of health and safety file. This includes test results and certifications.
"Site Set-up Traffic Management Accident / Incidents SHESQ Inspections. Other site inspections Occupational Health monitoring:  The Client site set-up and welfare facilities, including the site compound arrangements were well organized. JMS were able to make good use of the adjacent car park for a site compound/welfare facilities and separate lay down area. This was located close to the work area and well segregated from the public. Good security arrangements in place prior to entering the site, with speed restrictions and goal posts provided by JMS to identify overheads and alert deliveries and third parties of the risks associated. Traffic marshal /banksmen in place to enable safe movement in and out of site 1 non-lost time accident 09-04-17 – Whilst carrying out troughing works the injured party (IP) injured his finger. The IP had placed a lid down with the help of his colleague, but noticed that the lid was unstable (he Suspected due to ballast) so he lifted the near side to remove the ballast and secure the lid. In doing this He caught his middle finger (right hand) between the lid and the rim of the route. First Aid was administrated and IP was taken to the local A&E as a precaution. The IP was later discharged from hospital and returned to site. Throughout the project life the SHESQ team found the JMS site team were competent and very professional on site. Any findings identified as part of SHESQ inspections were closed out within the relevant timescales and pictures sent on for proof of close out. Finding highlighted during inspections were: · Housekeeping issues. · Firefighting equipment – faulty/defective equipment. · LOLER – inspection and testing of lifting equipment · PUWER – inspections not being recorded. · COSHH – assessments required · Excavations – protection of excavations. Weekly site inspections were also carried out by the site team. 2 no Director tours and 1 Senior manager’s tours completed by JMS Senior Management teams. Combined NR & Amey Senior management teams visited site and competed tours and inspections. Random drug and alcohol testing was completed with the site team in line with JMS and Network Rail requirements."
"Water Ecology Waste Management Corporate Social Responsibility As Balfour had worksite upstream, water monitoring undertaken prior to, and after project both upstream and downstream to ensure no negative effects from project. JMS operative discovered suspected badger sett and stopped works to report. Habitats checked for badgers. Camera survey completed to ensure the team and work was not interfering with the wildlife. Redundant outlier sett discovered in worksite, but main sett located some distance away. Works allowed to continue. 99.9% diverted from landfill. 1700tonnes excavated soils used to refill quarry site. Excavated materials stored as stockpiles under Non Waste Framework Directive. 30tonnes of excavated material taken to Essex Wildlife Trust – Langdon Visitor Centre using Waste Exemption to be used in sensory garden for children."
"Due to nature of the project the client was under pressure to meet programme dates relating to term times. We agreed to short lead in time to fall in with clients start date. i) Left inadequate preparation time for the Project Manager due to resources ii) Put pressure on the procurement of initial sub contract packages and affected the separation of packages as some detailing was not fully understood. iii) Displayed a proactive approach to the client who we were keen to make an impression on. Programme i)Essential completion dates met ii) Short lead in time affected some sequencing due to some details not being fully scrutinised iii)Additional works and delays were agreed with EOT claim with all parties satisfied and the operation of the school not affected. i) Insist upon the lead in time that we require. Ensure site team is briefed and has project information at the earliest opportunity. Support resources were increased. ii) Insist upon the lead in time that we require. Production of procurement schedule as early as possible. We have since been stronger with clients in regard lead in time and dictated what we require. iii) We maintained a proactive approach throughout the project which resulted in high client satisfaction and team ethic throughout. It needs to be considered carefully if the risk of a reduced lead in period is worth taking. i) Through planning, rescheduling where required, and close liaison with the school and project team key dates were met. ii) Insist upon appropriate preparation time and allocation of resources. iii) Good record keeping and clarity throughout."
"i) Site Set Up. Cramped office space. ii) Site set Up. General iii) Setting Out errors. iv)Construction methods. Scaffolding The scaffolding was not straight forward due to the nature of the building, different construction elements and access requirements Although a scaffold schedule was prepared variations arose. v)Access. Opportunities to use safe stand which would have been more economical to use with greater flexibility. However, no account and no trained operatives. i) Future logistics plans to incorporate 30ft offices where ever possible. Careful consideration of staff requirements ii) The set up was generally good and developed throughout project. Put forward for CCS award iii) Some mistakes throughout. Use of agency engineers with little preparation time and it is felt that they lacked the commitment of full time employee. iv) Careful thought and detailed scaffold schedule is imperative to reduce potential variations. v) Look to open account with SafeStand and arrange training. Put the provision of access into sub contractor packages where ever possible."
"i)Hoarding. Very slow in generating design. No temporary works engineer readily available. ii) Temporary works procedures were followed on site and no CARs at Audit .-Building to have an account with a Temporary Works engineer to enable designs at short notice. -JMS look at possibility of semi generic hoarding designs whereby requirements of various scenarios(wind loading, proximity to public etc) can be formulated to produce design required. ii)Maintain training of staff in Group Procedure and ensure resources available on site to enable working to procedure."
"i)All items of plant were off hired in line with group procedures. However, we are still being charged for some items. ii)Some items were stolen when the site was broken into. Many items were still being charged long after the theft ii)Electrical cabinet and materials for temporary supply purchased from Elec Dept. Materials returned to elec dept, uncertainty over credit? i)System needs looking into to ensure efficient on/off hire of internal and external plant. ii)As above iii)Should purchased items returned to Elec dept not be credited back to contracts?"
i)Lead in time affected appointments – As Progress/programme section ii)All sub contractor packages started on site in line with the contract programme. Inclusive of long lead in items. iii)Only 2no Pre Order meetings were held – Structural steel and Curtain walling. iv)Inadequate detailed analysis and surveying input resulted in variations in some packages. )The late payment of sub contractors caused issues on site in terms of productivity. i)as identified in progress/programme ii)Effective procurement schedule and programming iii)Ensure pre order meetings are held prior to appointment of critical packages to ensure ability to meet our requirements. iv)Packages to be more detailed .

i)JMS SWMP achieved 3 BREEAM credits. ii)No Environmental incidents. i)Maintain detailed SWMP. ii)Continue to follow legislation and Group procedures.
IT. Lack of full IT facilities affected running of the project at the early stages Look into getting site IT facilities up and running in shorter period of time.
Commencement delayed due to WCC / Portman legal / cost issues. Murphy committed to an ambitious pre-Christmas programme to deliver key elements for Portman. This was well received and improved repute with them. All costs covered and returned to standard working week Jan – June 14.
Design issues between WCC and Portman’s Developer / Architect Murphy retained a flexible approach whilst advising of foreseeable cost / programme impacts. Murphy proposals relating to material choice were accepted by all parties without future risk to JM. Murphy attendance at Stage 2 meetings may have avoided these issues but at cost which would not have been recoverable via contract.
Varying labour requirement to deliver scheme Murphy was able to increase labour pre-Christmas when other schemes were completing / being demobilised. Buy in from all parties and all costs covered.
Accoustic sheeting. Used successfully to limit noise pollution from ongoing works adjacent to high end retail properties
Procurement of specialist materials .Murphy able to incentivise key supply chain partners to improve lead times of late instructed materials. All costs covered and positive reputational effect.
Elements of FM Conway’s works were not to specification WCC agreed to write specifically to FMC (despite employment as JM subcontractor) raising issues which add to non-delivery evidence.
"Lack of clarity around design change and particularly progress / approval Relates to design as above. Following lack of clarity / progress in early states, regular meetings were held on site to resolve any issues in a more efficient manner."
Delayed design of public art Currently outside of West One / Murphy remit. Consider including in future schemes to avoid repeat / additional work with associated impact on project cost and programme.
Grosvenor initially specified an arduous testing regime considerably in excess of WCC requirements (West One Term Contract). West One proposal accepted to reduce testing requirements to WCC standard due to West One reputation and high standard of labour resource and supervision. Enhanced site investigation work undertaken at additional cost to Grosvenor which de-risked elements of the scheme.
Inefficient process interface between Grosvenor and WCC design teams Agree schedule of design activities prior to future schemes to improve timeliness and cost of design delivery without reducing quality of design information.
Sharing of future works programmed by Grosvenor to enable improved resource planning / retention Murphy prioritised labour resource to ensure scheme was completed to quality and programme required. These staff now have experience of delivering to enhanced specification and should be used to deliver similar future schemes if possible.
Combined welfare units .New units improve facilities for workforce and benefits to public include less space required and less visually obtrusive.
Procurement of specialist materials. Problems experienced with specialist stone units and bespoke cast iron tree grilles from Grosvenor’s nominated suppliers. West One alternative proposals accepted and delivered to required project constraints.
Tiling to specification but not in keeping with exceptional quality of scheme in general. Investigate alternatives to Grosvenor proposed subcontractor for future schemes to improve quality of this element of works.
"quality of scheme in general Investigate alternatives to Grosvenor proposed subcontractor for future schemes to improve quality of this element of works. -ve Contract Management (including Change Control) Double reporting to WCC and Grosvenor, excessive number of progress meetings and attendees. West One to provide additional clarity on reporting lines and change control process to reduce unproductive management hours on future schemes accepting that a high level of contract management is expected."

Dust from site sanding of natural stone paving Agreement with WCC / Grosvenor to adjust design details to avoid site sanding with splays to be used as alternative.
Commencement delayed due to WCC/National Grid Diversion works. Murphy took on the liaison of the gas diversion works with the stakeholders on behalf of WCC and National Grid. This enabled the works to progress to the benefit of WCC and Murphy with WCC covering the costs of our involvement in agreement with Ministry of Justice.
A plethora of Utility diversions were identified during the design states which would need to be undertaken before the security element of the works could be installed. Murphy undertook all the excavation works utilising a “right first time” approach. Each section was excavated once and each relevant utility attended site to move their apparatus thus eliminating the footway/carriageway being excavated on numerous occasions.
Design issues when utility apparatus clashed with security installation. Murphy surveyed all utilities when exposed and undertook value engineering exercises in terms of the costs of moving the utilities against minor modifications to the design. This approach not only saved time but also reduced the costs to WCC and MOJ.
Accoustic sheeting. Used successfully to limit noise pollution from ongoing works adjacent to the Royal Courts of Justice. Murphy also liaised closely with the RCOJ and judges were moved to different courts as our works progressed to limit their exposure to the noise.
Procurement of specialist materials. Murphy ordered the specialist security units at the onset of the project in agreement with WCC. This allowed us to overcome the long lead in time and operate a call off approach.
Elements of FM Conway’s works were not to specification .WCC agreed to write specifically to FMC (despite employment as JM subcontractor) raising issues which add to non-delivery evidence.
Design Changes that impacted on the security rating of the product. Murphy introduced a full change control process in agreement with WCC and The MOJ. Weekly meetings were held to discuss the changes and impacts and specialist 3rd party validation was undertaken for every change that impacted on the security rating of the product.
Shell in the Portland Stone. Murphy arranged for a visit to the quarry to view the stone. A range of samples were available and a range was picked and agreed on prior to the order being placed.
"Man Trunk Shaft S3 25m ID 33m Deep shaft Proposals for supporting the ground with SCL lead to a redesign to avoid use of SCL. Slippage of underpinned rings below the toe level of the Secant piled shaft occurred on one side of shaft with circle joints of the underpinned rings opening up to 75mm at locations diagonally opposite the tunnel portal. Opening of circle joints continued round approximately half circumference of shaft. The Lining slipped at the grout / Clay interface not the Grout Segmental lining interface The additional weight of the reinforced concrete and the segments hanging on the final ring with the additional 1000mm deep steel cage exceeded the bolt / thread strength The change in design did not account for a deviation in a design based on assumption on stability of ground rather than actual ground encountered. Corrective action has been completed – The ring was propped full ring built the open joints packed with nonshrink mortar and the annulus grouted. Base slab and under ream toe completed as design. Preventive action – Root Cause analysis to be communicated through lessons learnt. • Designs should be fully developed reviewed and accepted prior to starting construction • Requests for Design changes should be fully documented. • Designs should not be accepted through Method Statement • Use of Decal would help identify contractor review & acceptance status. Use of SCL or no SCL and open ground (witnessed as dry self- supporting competent clay may have introduced less risk, cost and unnecessary over complication of design. Designing for actual ground encountered verses a design for ground expected may not have introduced this risk. The Ground investigation would not have been as good as the ground exposed to view during the excavation of the shaft."
"Production and Management of Programme. Staffing Levels. Restrictions imposed by the Client’s specific requirements. Early involvement in the programme by the contractor is essential. Demobilisation and final reinstatement was not achieved. This activity was scheduled to be undertaken following the tie-ins which was in September but was affected by the ongoing demands placed by the NG board visits specifically the reinstatement which was not achieved until the following year. The addition by the client of extra work (7 separate sites) expected to be completed in a short duration prior to final tie-ins and required the detailed management of extra resources. MPL staff on the Tirley project management took on this extra work. Future works of this type need to be resourced appropriately. Project was delivered on time. With regards to the gassing up and commissioning of the site, the programme was developed to ensure that the tie[1]ins were carried out when the main PRI works were completed. This eliminated the risks and the permit requirements for working within a ‘Live’ site. Procedures were put in place over the pipeline once pressure tested and dried to treat it as a live asset."
Site / Office set-up (including security). Construction – RAMS. Proper planning for the site and office set-up was implemented which resulted in the only amendments being necessary were due to additions requested from the Client. MPL procedures were followed in all aspects of construction and setting out leading to minimal reworking. Commissioning meetings were initiated very early on in the project with a dedicated commissioning manager which mitigated the risks when we came to pre- and post[1]gas commissioning and testing. This has been implemented on the Beckton project.
Design Change Design Review Drawing Control Management of subcontract designers (including communication) Management of internal designers. JMS need to carry out more audits on design subcontractors. -ve MPL staff spent a considerable amount of time micro managing Jacobs’s quality issues at site level to ensure programme requirements were met. The Design Change Register was implemented at an early stage which was an invaluable tool to all disciplines. MPL fully managed drawing control in the absence of Jacobs’s system management. +ve Design meetings (getting all relevant parties around the table) were well managed from the start with regular design constructability reviews carried out by MPL during the design process. This ensured that the design was buildable and that there were no extra costs required for design re-work.
"TWC Permits to Load / Strike Suitability of Temporary Works Hoardings. Regular site staff meetings with work forecasts discussed led to accurate planning of all temporary works requirements and, in turn, the TWs were checked daily/weekly as dictated by site conditions. Due to the abundance of site services in and around the PRI area, a ‘Permit to dig’ system was implemented."
"Labour Staff Competence, Training, Experience .As the additional work load increased MPL staff took on extra work to ensure seamless management of work activities. This lead to prolonged durations of intense working hours. In future additional supervisory/management staff to be engaged as required. The group management of paying training invoices needs stream lining. Some training courses were disrupted because operatives were turned away from training courses due invoices not being paid prior to attendance. Estimating need to be aware of the requirement to use existing trained labour/operators and price subsistence allowance accordingly to future project. Training costs/ attrition rate of new/local labour is prohibitive."
Hire / Off-hire Maintenance / Certification. The requirement for the prolonged hire of machinery should be identified and planned to ensure benefit/option of the plant department to purchase machinery rather than hiring. Significant costs were incurred by the project carrying out onsite repairs and upgrades to plant to comply with Client requirements and PUWER regulations. Site plant off-hire returns sheets were being completed in accordance with Group procedure but were not being actioned by the Plant Department.
"Lead Times Requisitioning Incoming Inspection Stores Control Storage Stock Control Surplus / Wasted Materials There was an issue with the orientation of the actuator screen and valve handling with some of the Perar ball valves. The valves were out of warranty so there was extra costs/rework incurred. During the material ordering/procurement process, the MPL Expeditor must ensure the assembly of these items before they leave the factories and release materials by sign off against the design, MTO and purchase order. There was an issue with one 36” weld neck flange that was ordered as Raised Face (RF) and delivered as Ring type joint (RTJ). Due the size and weight, and the fact it was delivered with the flange faced down, it was not inspected upon delivery and the delivery documentation taken at face value. This lead to rescheduling of certain operations on the project and impacted on costs and the programme. During the checking of permanent materials i.e. Bolts. The material controller shall ensure that all dimensions are checked as per the delivery documentation/MTO. Due to lack of planning permission, MPL were required to store a lot of the equipment in Madley for 4 years+. This required the project to engage with the suppliers/vendors to ensure that the equipment was stored correctly. In addition to this, prior to the equipment being installed, MPL approached the vendors who recommended regimes to be put in place to ensure that there was no risk to Project Delivery ie. defective equipment. This included stripping down regulators, assembling ad operating valves as well as testing equipment (some of which failed the test). The manufacturers were also instructed to quote for extra warranty periods to ensure MPL could maintain their contractual agreement obligations."
Purchasing Lead times Management / supervision of (including communication) Competence & Experience The supervision resources and effort required to manage some subcontractors proves the point that the cheapest isn’t always the best. There was significant MPL input into the day-to-day activities of certain subcontractors. The Subcontractor Procurement Schedule needs developing at the earliest possible stage of the project and amended as project requirements dictate. Pre-appointment meetings proved an excellent tool in the selection process of sub-contractors.
"Tender / Estimate Understanding of contract / client requirements Administration of contract Change control (including time bar) Communication (including document control, progress meetings) Final Account .Accurate communication of changes onsite/ changes to work scope was communicated effectively between PM, CM, QS, and Planner and programme impacts reflected accurately on the monthly updates. MPL ran an NEC familiarisation course for relevant staff to ensure management of contract. Close working relationships developed with the Client’s team ensured good communication and amicable agreements to contract issues on a regular basis."
"Non-conformances CARs Records / Handover. MPL’s Document Controller ensured all project staff maintained their input to relevant section of the data books. This resulted in the ability of the project to hand over the data books etc. ahead of the scheduled programme. Regular client audits were undertaken and results were consistently positive. Our document control management also attracted one positive point on the Process Safety Triangle each month. It is critical that vendor data is properly communicated to both designers and Construction staff. Due to supplier availability (Europipe) the client supplied 500metres of 48” H/W pipe with a 3 layer polyethylene coating system. They do not have any details on their specification (C/W5) for coating the joints and we had to agree a technique – MCL with Serviwrap. Moreover, the client insisted on coating the welds on the auger bore pipe strings with Serviwrap which MPL stated was not recommended as it would get ripped off. This was the case. Moving forward, if the client is going to use pipe with this type of coating, agreement is to be reached for trenchless crossings."
"Traffic Management Welfare Facilities The project missed a chance to promote the high standards of safety on the project by registering the project for awards i.e. ROSPA -ve The project engaged with all personnel new to the project at an early stage and instructed on the high standards of health & safety required. The Tirley project engaged the trained resources at its disposal to enable the project to have experienced and trained staff that led to a high level of health and safety. For tie-ins, removal of the 3 layer polyethylene coating required heating up the inside of the pipe and removing and scraping the coating off. This generated fumes. The use of the internal pipe ‘spider’ allowed us to remove the coating as safely as possible."
"Negative – Warning letter from Environment Agency following complaint from local anglers that silt was entering stream leading to fish spawning ground. Positive – Many best practices arising from use of new, sustainable products (marker paint spray, GRP steps), innovative techniques for energy conservation and re-use of materials (eco friendly cabins, recycled mulch mats for tree planting, biodegradable plant pots, sustainable drainage for office parking area) etc. See two years’ worth of best practices for concise summaries. Positive – To prevent cross contamination of wastes, a system was trialled whereby the stores[1]man holds the key to the hazardous waste area. This prevented hazardous waste drums being cross - contaminated with incorrect waste.Site meetings with the Environment Agency’s local officer. A Plan of Action was agreed including work stoppages during heavy rains, water monitoring and an elaborate system of over-pumping and back-up pumps. Expensive system yet there were no further water management issues arising. Lesson learned - Siltation of watercourses and associated EA action can be avoided through sophisticated mitigations. These can be replicated on future jobs but resources will vary on each contract. Many of these best practices are simple to follow and are now being used on other projects within the company. Others (e.g. the Sustainable Drainage System for parking areas) are only applicable on longer term projects. This easy to set-up procedure minimised problems with mixing in the waste stream, a common finding on client inspections."
Ensure the consistency of planning on the project by nominating one person to deal with the planning issues.
"Delay in receiving feedback from designers caused a delay in the procurement of materials which could have been procured cheaper from alternative suppliers had a lead-time been available, or a supplier not been specified by the designers. Hedgerow removal was not recognised during Design. Extra hedgerow had to be removed during construction which was carried out during nesting season. In the hands of the client(sj). Try and ensure early contractor involvement (sj)."
"1. PM team was very good for this project and worked well together, although, due to the size of the Project, some personnel were only on site part time and therefore communication was a little broken. Personnel had a good working relationship and people were not afraid to ask for advice from others in team. It was helpful for the Project to have PM who had experience in both construction and safety. A good team effort throughout. However, this could have been enhanced further by holding weekly / monthly meetings to steer and guide the Project Team, provide updates on what is required and by when, and providing first-hand information on the Project. Visiting PMs and changing DPMs should be avoided if at all possible. Staff showed good awareness of environmental and health and safety. The Construction Manager and Site Foreman were very professional and co-operative. Murphy staff need to be briefed as to expectations of role – smaller project means more responsibility and scope. Project completed professionally, efficiently and safely. PM level headed, analytical, professional leadership, supporting the staff, delegating his responsibilities and fostering a ""can do"" attitude within the team. An improved meeting schedule including tele conferencing could improve this (sj). Consider introduction weekly / monthly Project Management Team meetings. An internal meeting at a set time each week would be useful. Weekly meetings should have taken place and this is an area that requires improvement (sj)."
"There should be H&S presence at the Subcontractors’ Pre-Start Meetings to emphasise the H&S requirements prior to them arriving on site. Murphy were understaffed in the early days of the project. NG’s Commercial Department were not clear with their instructions. NG’s Commercial personnel were allowed to attend Construction & Progress Meetings but Murphy Commercial personnel were not. 5. Level 2 prices should accurately reflect what is required within the Works Information. - 6. CE Quotes - more information is required to be able to price them quickly and efficiently - this needs engineering input. 7. No definitions to Provisional Sum Items including in the Contract. - 8. Confusion relating to payment of invoices with specialist contractors such as ALControl. 9. Lack of resources in MPL has meant extremely heavy workloads for some members of staff, which has resulted in certain aspects of the job not being carried out to the necessary standard and more time is now required to play catch up. Information on site allocation sheets is lacking in detail which makes it extremely hard to compile cost reports. Some Foremen need to be more focused when filling in allocation sheets - plant items and descriptions are often left off an allocation sheet. Foremen, engineers, ALO, environmental, safety and admin personnel should have a commercial induction to highlight the importance and relevance of correct recording. We need to drive commercial thinking into the construction process.  14. Lack of awareness in Commercial Department of roles of others on the Project. 15. Lack of understanding from others on the importance of keeping the Commercial Department informed, including allocation sheets. Introduce some mechanism to prompt commercial awareness - cost implication allocation sheet? Include Commercial Briefings in internal meetings? Project Commercial bulletins?"
Last minute ordering of certain products caused a slight problem. Delayed ordering could become a bigger issue on future projects with more off-site approvals being required before works can commence on site. Anyone working on the Project should be placing their orders with a minimum of at least 24 hours’ notice. For tight Programme projects this really needs to be given some advance thought and consideration to avoid later pitfalls.
Engineers should not be allowed to depart from the project whilst there are ongoing site issues. 2. Challenge design earlier – more robustly. Highlight risks and costs as key issues.  3. Murphy lack electrical engineer input – no MPL internal specialist / expert. HHF is the second project where E&I has proved challenging.
"Setting up of subcontracts still seems lacking. RAMS were sometimes not submitted until a day or so before work was due to start, which puts pressure on the H&S Department to review and puts pressure on the Client to approve. The majority of subcontractors used on HHF were competent and professional. With the amount of paperwork now required a large resource will be necessary to manage subcontractors. The new payment notices and withholding notices will be very time-consuming. There should be a H & S presence at prestart meetings to emphasise the H&S requirements prior to them arriving on site. On future projects, a programme when subcontractors are required on site is to be agreed at least six weeks before they are expected to commence on site, to allow for the approvals process. The programme could then be updated to track any subcontracts not yet placed. Earlier identification of subcontractors would lead to earlier submissions of necessary documents, including RAMS."
"There was a slight problem with some of the H&S Advisors being unfamiliar with the Murphy Procedures as they were not directly employed.  2. Positive feedback received from the Client outweighed the negative . 3. The IOSH Training given to some supervisors seemed to help the safety cause – we now seem to be thinking about safety and the job, not just the job. 4. IOSH course for the Foremen has had a beneficial effect on their attitude and safety performance. 5. Full-time Plant Checker employed – not only to collect plant defect sheets but to maintain weekly registers for ladders, lifting accessories and fire extinguishers. 6. The Training Room on site proved more efficient than sending personnel away for training. 7. The H&S on site was generally quite good, however, more training would be useful at all levels. Hazard Cards: need to put more emphasis on completing and submitting the cards. Documentation was generally good although the Operation Procedures etc. seemed to be produced at the last minute. Foremen to carry out daily briefings ensuring the construction teams are aware of their responsibilities and help to achieve KPI targets by identifying and removing hazards. Site Foremen should get their crews to complete – one per week from each person would be a big improvement. Submit Procedures for Works at least 6 weeks in advance - these can be identified via the Programme."
"Seemed to work well - did we miss opportunities with silt mitigation measures. Could more have been done / been installed as it was a Provisional Sum item?  2. Fencing : ensure the contractor is installing to the correct standard and is aware of the standard prior to pricing. On HHF the contractor was a bit slow due to resourcing which resulted in a delay in starting the capture period. Installation method with plough very good. Murphy could do with sufficient resources – fencing can be completed very quickly with right kit.Weekly checks of all spill kits is excessive and time consuming (1/2 day per week). Look at options for using seal tags on the spill kits or add the spill kit check to Daily Plant Inspection. 4 Waste segregation - question if transporting waste to transfer station un-segregated in one bin is more sustainable. We could still achieve same recycling rates, but lower cost and carbon footprint. 5. GCN mitigation excellent and very well managed. Fence material used on HHF was far superior to the polythene used on previous projects - no extra cost and produced a better quality barrier which required far less maintenance. 6. Steel newt channel - good idea but did not stand up to heavy machinery trafficked over it. Possibly countersink the channel between bogmats to prevent damage? 7. Lagoon for dewatering - worked well, but lesson learnt to ensure that all land drains around it are cut off during construction. 8. Approx 90% of Hazard Cards submitted came from Murphy & NG Environmental Advisors. 9. Weeds sprayed too late in the season – the weeds had all produced seed heads by the time spraying was done which could cause issues next year.

"Several new practices were adopted and beneficial to the project. All project documents to be stored on the F:drive providing greater access to staff across folders. Material vendors seemed to be left to their own inspection - no obvious final client inspection taking place. -ve 4. The free-issue pipe grade was different to Murphy welding procedure requirements resulting in additional procedures being produced and approved. Project documentation such as plans, OPS etc should be submitted well in advance of works - seem to always be submitted at the last minute. As we know standard OPS to be issued, could these not all be sent at start of Contract for ""generic"" works? Would it be cost effective to house the server in London and use VPN? Consider linking the issue of documentation to the Programme to ensure we submit at appropriate times?"
"Consider the training that Murphy H&S advisors can deliver, and also what training they themselves may require, eg environmental Bring people in a day or two early and have this time set aside to ensure that the training needs for their particular job are catered for. Could more people have attended training courses to make them more efficient - was the trainer's visits to site utilised as much as it could have been?"
"Good in the main. However, the isolated units were not the best, and having to move offices two or three times was disruptive and not conducive to good working practices. -ve 2. Poor - cramped and with inadequate ventilation."
"Poor setup to start which made things extremely difficult to work effectively - problems continued intermittently throughout the Project. When it works, it was good. Office support should be available from IT during site working hours, not just 9.00 am till 5.00 pm. Initial teething problems - we need to be faster at getting IT set up at start of project. 4. Lack of support from IT Dept on occasions - sometimes a site issue is more urgent that the IT Dept deem it. Perhaps some IT staffing resources could adjust their working times, ie. start and finish early, some to start and finish later to cover site hours."
"Could have been a lot better - NG has wanted a top quality job but has not wanted to pay for it. There have been very few get-togethers and when they were arranged, it was all too late and most people had either already left the Project or had other commitments. 2. If the Client wanted something done, it was easier to complete straight away than discuss it, which did make the job easier.. Minimal in terms of commercial aspects of the job - could have been better to avoid some of the problems were now faced with. 4. Works should not have been carried out by MPL without PMIs from NG. NG ALO wanted a change in the drainage in Plot 15, but did not want to put his name to it. 5. PMIs issued from NG at the last minute - allowed events to happen before NG would approve CE quotes submitted by MPL."
Good forward progress made on site 2. NG enforcement of unrealistic programme within Contract document has lead to later problems. (i.e. problems with extension of times for weather compensation events etc.) - 3. NG late change of weather recording centre meant loss of weather CE for Snow in February 2012. Check locations of weather stations prior to contract to ensure records are available
"Bow in weld mesh, out of specification.>200mm. Reduce the time of excavations remaining open. New doors reducing the clear opening. Pin kerbs to new concrete paths. Anti slip to tower foundations. Problems bolting the mesh together. Access to sill for concreting etc. Good set up which worked well. IT links were not the best (as a Satellite was used). Steel cabins blanked mobile telephone reception. Lack of clarity from NG re Commissioning dates. 1. Ensure tech partner uses torque wrench when tensioning the electric fence 2. Tension weld-mesh prior to concreting. 3. Install bracing on the fence prior to fitting the mesh. Pre-cast tower foundation. This should be checked prior to doors being ordered. Omit the pin kerbs and finish edges with Harris trowel. Brush finish to be applied rather than steel trowel as stated. Peter Jackson (Jacksons Fencing) is looking into alternative Avbolt system. System formwork staging to be used rather than timber. Consider using GSM boosters in cabins."
Fence levels found to be incorrect on AFC drawing. FCC / PCC fixing too close to edge of concrete. Change of design from Quick stage steps to concrete. Handrails earthing / touch potential. Design Co-ordinators responded well to requests for outstanding information to allow completion of the works on site. Incomplete sections of design requiring further design input from Mott MacDonalds. The Designers should provide the full scheme design to allow for pricing of all works up front to NG. Site Manager engagement. NG being very slow to decide what is required with respect to the vehicle mitigation barrier. In depth survey of entrances prior to design. Perimeter level surveys to be taken (Additional surveys to be undertaken especially if topography of site is complicated. A detailed SoW for surveyors to be produced to ensure information necessary for design is recorded i.e. spot heights taken at a relatively closely spaced grid (especially at gates and kerb lines) and JMS & Designers full requirements and method of presenting drawings undertaken. Motts are using Civil 3D going forward to model sites. A review of all surveying subcontractor to be carried out to ensure underperforming subcontractors are not used going forward. Increase the size of cabinet foundations (JMS design team have requested the updated Chubb ‘standard drawings’ and will do a full review on sites going forward.) Design to be concrete (Kwiksteps agreed with NG at early design meetings. Early Warning raised to highlight change). GRP hand rails to be used eliminating the touch potential. Site Manager to be nominated as early as possible in design phase so they can be involved in design process. This will provide invaluable construction knowledge and design can be detailed to suit any preferred construction methodology.
Temporary “Heras” type fencing both inside and outside of the new fence line worked well on site. It provided a good working corridor. 2. Temporary access roadways allowed safe access to be gained to the works  3. Reinstatement via Provisional Sum item allowed for full recovery of actual work costs. 4. Pinch point Provisional Sum item allowed for full recovery of costs associated with these works.

Place a web based “further courses calendar” that is available to all Project Managers/H&S Advisors to enable them to plan training accordingly. This could also reduce losing training places by not filling courses to their maximum capacity. The training calendar could be on a link via MurphyOnLine, read only and bookings completed by a centralised booking co-ordinator. Take a firmer stance on those that do not turn up for training that has been booked and will have to be paid for and they don’t have a strong enough excuse for non-attendance. Reduction of subsistence costs (hotel / food / travel / train / car mileage) considerably. These performed well Senior management / Haydock should do more to push NG to address this issue."

Facilities good but Dav-Lav only emptying at meal times should be avoided. Ensure Effluent Waste is removed outside of Meal Times and Project Board Visits
Removal of hedges and trees within nesting season. Complaints from close proximity neighbours. Storage and handling of fuels / diesel within 50m of watercourse and an EA monitored borehole. Remove outside nesting season if possible. There should be a proper assessment of what trees need to be removed before the works commence. There were numerous visits to the site by the tree fellers after the initial works. This resulted in significant additional costs and also the requirement for additional ecological surveys. Letter drop to close proximity neighbours If there are works in proximity to residents or other sensitive receptors the council should be contacted and advice sought regarding the requirement for Section 61 consent and mitigation measures which may be required. PPG guidelines need to be followed for the safe storage fuels. Diesel tanks should always be stored over 30m from a watercourse and over 50m from a well or borehole. There was also refuelling operations carried out in proximity to a borehole and the watercourse.

Removal of hedges and trees within nesting season. Complaints from close proximity neighbours. Approximately 1500 m3 of excavated material was used for re-profiling / landscaping on site resulting in a significant cost-saving and more sustainable alternative to disposal offsite. Remove outside nesting season if possible. Letter drop to close proximity neighbours. This practice should always be considered at design and discussed with the planning authorities where necessary. Bunds can be created as visual screening around the sites.
"Chamber construction - durations underestimated. Good planned progress achieved generally on welding operations One crew operating two weld plants achieved planned production and worked well. Programme tracking poor at the outset to ensure we flagged up any issues. It was necessary to produce multiple revisions of the programme to aid client acceptance. Progress was generally hindered on all activities and disrupted by unsustainable Client requests / constraints. Though the programme broke down all activities, the estimated durations were not met due to access constraints not allowing realistic durations. On any future butt-fusion jobs we should adopt this practice and use One Crew and Two Weld Plants. There wasn’t a full-time Planner assigned to the Project and this did not assist in programme tracking. Where the site team consider the programme acceptable but the Client is indicating non[1]acceptance, the issue should be escalated rather than incorporating the comments and whims of the Client into our programme. A stronger stance to be taken with any new Client to force JMS safe methods of work. Escalate to higher level at an earlier stage if there are significant delays caused by the Client’s requests and constraints on our documented procedures."
"Running two welding machines at once side by side using the same crew resulted in good production each day and being ahead of schedule. There was a lot of ground water that needed controlling when the trench was being excavated which resulted in a additional costs for the hire of the pumps and the labour to refuel the pumps etc. We were constructing on a small easement which resulted in production being slower due to the lack of space for storing excavated material and major access issues. When welding plastic pipe on any job the welding crew should use two machines getting double production. Even if it is only a single line the pipe strings can be engineered so they can be welded and dragged into position. When pricing for any work in Cumbria (or other known heavy rainfall or high-water table areas) JMS need to consider the potential increased costs and allow for additional pumps and manpower. When working with a 15m easement JMS need to allow more time for the works to be carried out with additional plant and labour to keep the backfill tight up with the ditching. The narrower easement was accepted at tender stage as a Client constraint; however, as a new Client it was difficult to communicate this issue at tender without losing job. With new Clients it is suggested that a mini[1]informal HAZCON or similar should be arranged to share information and manage expectations and understandings."
"Originally the project was the Client’s design, JMS assisted in finalising the incomplete / flawed design. HDD – JMS design. JMS recommendations regarding the track crossing was finally accepted by the Client - additional HHD carried out. Veolia’s design was not good to go or showing any signs of being ready in time. JMS then spent time designing the job due to Veolia’s incomplete and poor design. All the grades and positions of chambers where designed by JMS. This resulted in the number of chambers being reduced in one section but more being required in the next section as they had been missed by Veolia. Third Parties / Landowners / Tenants were mismanaged by Veolia at the outset and the situation only became worse. Veolia then tried to involve JMS No ownership or control of liaison between SL & VW. It is probably more beneficial for JMS to stand back rather than engaging in assist new Clients with their design. Design executed efficiently. Though time was expended in advising the Client, the right decision was reached. JMS proposed a second HHD which was accepted by the Client resulting in value engineering and time saved by eliminating the ground difficulties and obstacles that would have been encounter if the open cut method had been chosen. The Client received good value engineering but JMS had to put time and effort into a design which Veolia took the credit for. Delays and complications relating to access and conditions arose daily due to mismanagement and this impacted upon JMS production. A Client – Contractor Workshop should be arranged prior to arrival on site to give clear understanding as to who is responsible for what with regards to liaison."
"Client commented on TW and JMS altered the suitability of Temporary Works. The Client consistently challenged TWs. The Temporary Works was managed on site as per the Murphy Group Procedure but there were a lot of misunderstandings with both Veolia and Sellafield as they all had their own opinion about what they felt was adequate. Due to not using a trench box at one of the tie[1]ins at a road crossing, JMS were stood down until the issue was resolved resulting in a lot of lost time and money. JMS to refuse to adapt to petty and minor comments of presentation which ultimately delayed process. A more robust approach to be adopted by JMS on future projects to deter the Client interfering in temporary works. JMS are a competent contractor with a wealth of experience in temporary works. JMS also have very experienced people within their temporary works department. At the start of each project JMS must stick to their procedures and not let the Client dictate what they feel is adequate when controlling the temporary works on site. JMS foremen and supervisors must be made more aware about temporary works and their responsibilities and training provided if necessary."
"Additional unforeseen labour and staff required. A decision was made at an early stage not to have a site canteen. Client request to accelerate – JMS submitted costs for this but in hindsight missed an opportunity to recover more staff resources than was actually submitted. VW & SL had a lot more site staff (as probably receiving recovery per head etc) and as most were new recruits they felt it important for them to make a name for themselves. JMS were out-numbered in the man-marking stakes which lead to excessive attendance on Client requests and therefore not allowing time for more important duties. There was a lot of additional labour and staff required for the project which wasn’t identified at the outset. Time expended on off-site trips. Remote projects need site canteen facilities. On future projecsts when faced with a similar situation a more varied approach should be undertaken to review all options such as sub[1]contracting, alternative methods. With new Clients, ensure a Contractor workshop takes place to discuss roles and duties to make the Client more aware of how manage our construction operations etc."
"Plant control / documentation was lacking at times with regard to on/off hire. Since this Project, MPEP have instigated a robust system of controls."
A Storeman wasn’t allocated to the Project. A full-time or part-time resource should be allocated to control stores.
"Tender Value. Changes Changes and delays occurred as a consequence of lack of access, errors in design, scope increases, severe weather conditions, etc. which had a serious impact on the execution of the works such that it was impossible to work productively throughout the contract period. Compensation Events JMS didn’t always submit Compensation Event quotations in the required time frame. It must be noted however, that VW were culpable of not assessing some of these Compensation Event quotations in the required time frame. Weather - Rain Delays The amount of rain encountered during the term of the works was much greater than could have been anticipated at time of tender. The contract had a nominated NEC weather station and the relevant clause to trigger a CE should the 1-in[1]10 average be exceeded. This station however was some 40 miles away from the site and is widely considered to be at a drier location. Although we had two weather events which resulted in CEs, the recompense of the associated costs can in no way be deemed proportional. Delays due to access Sensitivity to SL interests re land owners / third parties seriously impacted upon progress and access VW were not in control of the situation which led JMS’s position to suffer. Health & Safety In July 2012, the Client imposed a Safety Stand down due to a number of breaches in H&S. The main stand down resulted in a week of the labour force being stood down and no production being possible in this time. This happened at a time when JMS were fully resourced for the works. Programme / Resources. Documentation JMS were dealing with an employer who was, in effect, acting as a “middle man” between JMS and the end Client, Sellafield Limited. The level of detail, which was required for a number of the paperwork elements of the works, was above and beyond what would be classed as the industry norm. This in turn delayed certain works from starting when they should have and resulted in out of sequence working. The contract stated that RAMS need to be to a standard to the Project Manager’s satisfaction so no recourse was open to seek recovery. Easement Width. Allocation Sheets The quality of the daily allocation sheets which were completed and submitted by the site labour crews was of a poor standard. Cost Forecasting It became evident as the project progressed that the allowances made in terms of the costs being forecast were inadequate and insufficient to cover the actual costs on a monthly basis. Prior to entering into the contract agreement for the main works, JMS were awarded two purchase orders for advanced works. The on/off approach by the Client was not beneficial to a productive work approach. At outset of a Project, CEs need to be issued in compliance to contract. Though there was no other alternative weather station near to the Project, alternatives should be sought in similar situations on future projects. The Project was essentially not ready for execution when JMS mobilised, however, as VW/SL is a new Client JMS over-compensated to appease the Client in the hope that matters would be resolved. The work involved in the chamber construction was significantly underestimated in terms of both the tender allowance and the time needed to complete each activity. In addition to the chamber construction mentioned above, a number of elements, from looking at the cost estimate, seem to have been under priced. For example, the contract price allowed for only £730,000.00 for provision of labour to execute the works whereas in reality the project spent approximately £1.5 million on labour. This was the result of more labour resources being required than anticipated; longer durations than expected and short working days which JMS envisaged would have been extended. It was also decided that JMS would pay the labour force for a 12-hour day whereas, at most, they only worked for 10 hours. There is also the under pricing of other elements of the works such as the permanent materials and the volume of vehicles/plant on the job, all of which contributed to the losses. The sheer volume of RAMS and Work Instructions needed to satisfy the client could never have been anticipated pre- contract. The width of the easement (15 meters), which was agreed by JMS, was un-conducive to the nature of the works. With such a small easement, coupled with the stock piling of materials, the work could only move along at a reduced rate as compared to that of our usual easement width. Allocation Sheets MUST record relevant information. A need for more accurate cost forecasting and reconciliation with tender allowances has been identified. This needs to be implemented in order to not only identify any issues, but also and more importantly, the magnitude of the issues. All future projects require cost forecasts generated from site."
"There were a lot of pre-pour inspections etc for all the civil works from both Veolia and Sellafield with different parties inspecting the works at different times and on some occasions by different personnel. Inexperienced client reps/ personalities / SL/VW relationship led to the Quality Plan and ITP never being accepted, and the level of inspection (at nuclear level) far exceeded necessity. When JMS are the subcontractor and the contractor and client both want to inspect the works there should be one joint inspection for each item of works to prevent delays etc. JMS could not argue issues effectively as ITT inferred standards. Quality Plan and ITP to be presented prior to commencement on site to ensure the documents meet with the Clients’ expectations."
"Producing RAMS / Work Instructions etc. VW staff inexperienced and led by reaction of SL. No clear requirements which led to multiple comments and revisions. Inexperienced Client reps that were empowered to make judgement of client behalf. At the outset the issues should have been escalated to senior level. However, it was a difficult call to make with new Clients. On future projects with new Clients, a clear understanding of requirements should be established. JMS need to be able to handle the Client representatives and guide situations - if this is possible."
Works in SSSI and ecological sensitive areas managed well with no incidents. The EA Hotline was contacted and given the contact details of the key site personnel who received an email and free call to their mobile warning of heavy rain and flooding resulting in plant and equipment being made safe before the floods occurred etc. Plant and materials where made safe on a number of occasion before the floods came which prevented damage and costly repairs etc.
Opportunity to demobilise after completion of the second Purchase Order prior to formal contract award was not fully considered by JMS due to keeping in with the new Client and the consequences of letting them down etc. Should a similar situation arise (very rare) a high level for and against process should be implemented to fully review options.
No design procedure or guidelines put in place by DSJV at contract award. Design Scope and requirements was drip fed through making resourcing difficult. Clients lack of knowledge hindered work progression. Insistent on agreed procedure so design can be managed by both parties effectively. Insistent on agreed procedure so design can be managed by both parties effectively. Insistent on agreed procedure so design can be managed by both parties effectively.
"Adequate resources were put in place to manage an Option E Contract. Overall a very capable project team. To effectively manage an Option E project, suitable resources need to be in place particularly commercially. Keeping a project team consistent and not moving staff off to other projects has obvious benefits."
Materials supplied from KT were very hard track. Tickets issued by General Stores etc. will not stand up to Client scrutiny due to lack of detail. Lack of Commercial Knowledge amongst site teams. No idea of the importance of timesheets and records on an Option E contract. No clarity/ guidance from Client on tender rates –v[1]audit rates caused much ambiguity throughout the life of the project. More detailed back up is required from HQ and particularly P&T. Continuous toolbox talks / presentations to get point across. Agreed Contract to be in place at the commencement of works.
Supply of vans with new labour coming to site was hard to justify to the Client but also very difficult to take away from an individual. Last minute ordering of plant and materials. Clear guidance to be given on the issue of vans at commencement of employment. Better up front planning from site.
"Poor quality materials procured by the Buying team, particularly consumables. Materials were delivered on time and to schedule. Buying department need to review their buying procedure. Up front planning is crucial."
Key Programme dates were met.
"Traffic management: Traffic barrier on the A12 at Wick Lane. JMS had a site stand down until calculations were provided for the barrier and the required exclusion zones as the site team deemed the site unsafe to work after a third party set up the traffic management fixed barrier. All JMS personnel were subject to a medical provided by DSJV who used Express Medicals in conjunction with Construction Better Health (CBH). Even though Murphy use Express Medicals and are also part of CBH we were not allowed access to the records. Pressure put on crews by the Client to work in close proximity to UKPN plant without any guidance from UKPN. No support was given from DSJV or the Principal Client. Method Statements and Risk Assessments far too detailed, message was lost. In order to have the necessary medical records JMS, as a competent contractor, had to put all JMS personnel through another medical for Occupational Health records. This is something that needs to be discussed with Express Medical and the CBH organisation at a higher level i.e (JMS OCC Health Manager). Work stopped and guidance sought from UKPN. Set out with Client at an early stage a RAMS format."
"Longer procurement time required to ensure all checks are made, such as value for money, three quotes received, all documentation is in place etc. As JMS as we were working off Client instructions, our procurement / run in time to organise subbies was almost non existent"
Delays to commencement of the project due to the lack of Chubb design. NG would not allow JMS to proceed with the works until an integrated design was achieved. Start to the works was delayed for over 8 weeks. Design Co-ordinator responded well to requests for outstanding information to allow completion of the works on site. Major issues with the Chubb cable design late being on the project. Capita Symonds’ design overall was very poor and support to the site teams could have been better. The building hardening design outlined in the SSOR and OR was ambiguous and led to locks/doors having to be changed late in the project. Data books. The Red Line Mark-ups to be completed prior to the Site Engineer being transferred. DCN managed well as audits proved. Increased involvement with the technology contractor at design stage. Ensure management of design follows through on future projects. This is out of the control of JMS. Ensure the commercial team recover any delays incurred by JMS. Capita should not be used again. TQ to be raised at an early stage in the design. Site team to be involved more in compilation of as-built documentation – ongoing throughout the Project. On projects going forward. Method continued on future projects.
"Issues with maintaining Document Controllers working on the project. The Document Controllers supplied from agencies were lacking competencies. Overall The JMS site team were excellent and received excellent support from JMS Senior Management. The project became disjointed towards the end due to the timing of staff movements dictated by other projects’ start dates. . Screening of staff prior to commencement. In future admin clerk title may suit role of document controller better as most newly recruited document controllers have been using software systems where JMS use first principles etc. Carried through on future projects. Future projects require a more robust handover, although the Project did not suffer as a result."
The delays associated with the G17 sign off at the start of the project will obviously have a negative commercial impact overall. Resources were kept on site with little productivity. EWN raised in a timely manner. Good commercial / contractual management from the JMS team. Members of the client commercial team may be a little inexperienced which made simple commercial matters more complicated. Costs associated with internal plant hire needs to be reviewed internally at a senior level as charges for some items are excessive while others are low. Copies of all delivery dockets maintained on site which made it easier to agreeing variations with the client. This was a lesson learned from previous ISS projects. Harder decisions to be taken to relieve commercial pressures in future. Refrain from mobilising too early. Carried through to other projects. Ensure site has adequate support. This is ongoing. Improved system of managing plant towards the end of the project carried through to future projects.
All materials were on site when required so no major issue with procurement.All small electrical tools drills/saws should be purchased at the beginning of a project and not hired. Less cost to the project.
"Temporary works well maintained and managed on site. Change control well monitored and recorded. Civil audits both internally and client went very well. No NCRs were raised. Some concrete finishes were not to specification. Design detail around the main vehicle gates were not detailed enough. Ensure good practices are passed on to future projects by use of this process. Ensure that the site engineer briefs the construction team of the site finishes required for the particular project, ie. brush finish / float finish / edges trowelled. This would ensure the correct finish is applied and automatically applied in the same manner as the last project. Ensure the fine detail is thoroughly reviewed at an early stage to ensure no delays during construction. This is a lesson not learnt from earlier projects."
There were issues with all building hardening subcontractors particularly their site engineers that were doing the installations on site. Poor safety and very slow to do the work. JB Corrie operatives were actually clueless. Plant hire subcontractors were good with good back up support. Ensure a rigorous subcontract vetting process is adopted. Ensure sub[1]contractor evaluation forms are completed and published. MOH0001-FOR-00024. Evaluation of Subcontractor.docx. Ensure feed positive feedback to plant hire department.
As already stated the delays at the start of the project had prevented the works from commencement until mid August even though we started mobilisation mid April. Excellent progress achieved on site with construction zones being handed over to Chubb nearly two months ahead of programme. The negative side to this is that in future projects NG may be reluctant to agree programmes based on outputs used on the Aylesbury baseline programme. Weekly monitoring of progress helped maintain high productivity on site. Resist the temptation to mobilise to early. Continue with good construction management practices.
"Aylesbury site was one of the first projects to implement a Site Safety Management System which was commended by the NG project Board. Excellent document system on site and well maintained. Two minor injuries with operatives complaining of back injuries. One issue with an individual claiming of slipping on a Saturday afternoon however not reporting until the following Monday morning. Makes it difficult for site to confirm the incident actually happened. Some of the project board visits had negative feedback which was not a true and accurate reflection on the works/operatives/ management on site. Led to poor morale at times. Continue to drive for perfection, ensure that project team realise that there good work does not go un noticed. Ensure that staff are retained and that they pass on good practices. Adopt the best practice of staff signing off work as fit as well as signing on. Management to reassure staff of the true picture. The client is not always correct."
Excellent waste segregation on site. South section of site subject to serious flooding on a few occasions throughout the duration of the project. Lagoons in place for pumping and no environmental incidents. Recycled aggregate used on site for compound and haul road construction was generally poor. During periods of wet weather ground conditions were poor. Ensure that staff are retained and that they pass on good practices. Ensure areas at risk are identified at an early stage and that a sustainable pumping and filtration system is maintained. Recycled aggregate is not always the best way forward particularly in areas that are subject to heavy traffic. This should be agreed with NG at commencement of project.
Pre-casting of bases was carried out on site which was recognised as a positive working practice by NG board. This form of construction was originally used at Peters Green. The use of concrete blind was considerably reduced by implementing a new shuttering procedure. The blinding was poured the exact width of the cill and using tying wire with clamps to tie the shutters at the bottom. Continue the learning from past projects by ensuring this lessons. learnt process is followed and passed forward. This method has its +ve and –ve and was not adopted by other projects. More inter-site communication to ensure the most effective and efficient methods are adopted.
"Resources on site were made up from operatives who had previously worked on CNI projects so very little training was required. Some Deep excavation training/ HSG 47 training organised for supervisors were not recognised by NG. Proved to be a waste of money as training needed to be redone. Citrus training was the organisation that carried out this training and should be removed from the JMS vendor list. JMS must try to retained weekly paid staff, this reduces training costs, improves HS&Q on site. Training coordinator to be made aware of issues. Ensure sub[1]contractor evaluation forms are completed and published. MOH0001- FOR-00024."
Good canteen facilities were used by the client occupying the compressor station.
Excellent Facilities. Facilities were set up to accommodate JMS staff not working on the Aylesbury Project however preparing works for future projects. NG used meeting room for meetings also associated with different projects.
"Problems with achieving connections to the site during site mobilisation, however excellent IT in operation for the duration of the project. Project F Drive filing system not user friendly or compatible with the works. Project F Drive not being used by all or to its full potential. This risks loss of information due to staff changes, inability to review project files remotely. Difficult to compile Data Books, information not accessible for future reference. Continued feedback to IT regarding temporary solutions. A good fixed line improves production and prevents frustration. Currently working with IT to improve the file structure. Project Management to ensure F Drive is used to its full potential. Ensure personnel understand their responsibilities."
Excellent relationship established and maintained with the NG Operation staff within the Compressor Station. This assisted with the smooth integration of the JMS works.
"Though Civils design integrated with the Technical Partner at commencement on site, the Tech Partner subsequently required additional ducting to bases resulting in re-work to a number of bases. Design Change management generally complied with requirements. The Technical Partner did not provide a large enough breaker for the JMS-supplied HVAC unit. This was not realised until very late in the project as there was no power available to test the breaker at the time. Written confirmation from the Technical Partner’s site team required prior to casting or installing ducts. To be repeated on future Projects. It transpires that JMS were not at fault but with more diligence this may have been discovered at an earlier stage. JMS not to be scoped with any electrical appliances - only Civils design."
"Large turnaround of engineers with three leaving did not affect site activities due to timely handover. Site Manager transferred too soon at end of project. When the PC role was handed to the Technical Partner and JMS activities became very minor, JMS were faced with some inadequacies with our documentation time constraints attending site. This mainly stemmed from a resource issue as we had four sites in a similar stage and not enough resources to cover all. Site team to take responsibility of Data Book close out. Timely handover of role and responsibilities when personnel leave the Project. Site Manager to be retained for full close out of site activities. 1. We need to sharpen our approach to closing out projects quicker. 2. Ensure that when JMS is the PC representative we approach the role in a similar manner to the Technical Partner. All future projects."
"Good input from site team (Foreman, Engineer etc.) identifying Early Warnings. Some elements of work affecting the Technical Partner were not signed off as acceptable upon civils completion which exposed JMS to third party costs from the tech partner later in the project. Due to the short civils programme, the triangle scores for H&S and Environment were below the KPI target resulting in fee reduction at Final Account settlement. To be repeated on future Projects. All works directly affecting the tech partner to be rigidly checked and signed off by JMS & TP prior to civils completion. Future projects with short programmes to adopt more Best Practices to reach KPI target. Possibly challenge the KPI with the Client prior to contract award."
"All materials deliveries / subcontracts were completed in line with the programme avoiding any delay damages linked to Key Dates. Control of plant and on-hire and off-hire very poor at the end of the project, resulting in missing items and extra costs to the project. To be repeated on future Projects. If there is no Site Management on site, the Foreman to be responsible. This issue requires further consideration as similar issues are still happening."
"Gate buckled – this issue has been repeated on numerous sites, possible cause: i. gates not correctly supported during delivery or ii. during fabrication welds pull on material? Gates need to be thoroughly checked before and immediately after delivery although this is often difficult and not always possible."
"Due to NG requirements (EUSR training, Disclosure Scotland etc.) the number of subcontractors available to price works packages is significantly limited. All subcontract works were completed to a high standard and did not cause any issues later in project (ie. snagging). All suppliers – Certification and O&M requirements to be included on the Purchase Order (as important as installation) and received prior to payments. We often struggle to obtain material certification and O&Ms which are requirement for the databook and lack of this documentation has a knock-on effect to closing the project. Challenge with NG and potentially include an element in our price for providing the necessary training for subcontractors. Utilise the same subcontractors on future projects. Site Manager to enforce purchasing practice and QS to be kept informed. Going forward, and is starting to happen slowly."
Works generally carried out well within programme.
"All aspects of NG / JMS health, safety and welfare requirements were met. The importance of the triangle scores was not realised during the life of the project, and consequently the resultant KPI expectations was not achieved. The programme for the project was of a short duration, and the HS&E triangles fell short of the 40 score. Future triangles to be better managed (especially for short duration projects with limited time to attain the KPI targets). All members of the site team to be made aware of the importance of the Triangle Scores. (Note: this is now happening on the current project)."
Poor IT provision; various systems were tried out (a repeat of the IT issues on other projects). IT equipment to be listed and maintained on a Register similar to the Plant Register – this did not happen on Chalgrove. The situation has been considered at length and a suitable solution has not been arrived at yet. Ensure an IT Equipment Register is produced and managed on future projects.
"Lack of integration between the two contractors on their proposed designs. Part C not available at estimated start time. Pale length – pales were made 25mm longer without anyone noticing. This pushed the level of the concrete down as the pales were used as the offset. While the concrete was then 25mm lower the gap between the bottom electric wire and the cill was over 100mm in some locations. Poor identification of gas mains during trial hole stage. Removal of Oak trees. As per item 1 above gates not fully coordinated with tech partner. More meetings and integration before construction contract award, to avoid delays on site. Part C needs to be in place at contact award and site is mobilised. Part C needs to be in place at contact award and site is mobilised. Spot measure all materials in ITP. Have more robust fence installation check sheet (Now in place). Tape measure was used to identify trial hole depth and locations. A setting out engineer has been used on all jobs since, gathering a more accurate results for service positioning. It was recognised early in the design phase that the construction over the roots on the two oak trees had the potential to destabilise the trees and it was agreed by all parties to take them down and remove this hazard from the construction works. All drawing effecting tech partner need to be signed off by them prior to fabrication."
"Teamwork. Communication. Problem Solving. Requirement for Staff on site. Project staff released too soon or not being able to attend site to finish role duties on site. Effective project management team was built and maintained throughout the project life-cycle. Communication was regularly maintained with the project team on site and also members from the wider network of support. All members contributed positively to address problems and devising solutions. Make sure all work is finished / or that work which is not finished is identified and tidied up at a later date. ie. Red lines, data book requirements, concrete records closed and are with the document controller."
"Compensation Events are generally not agreed on time. Try to get Compensation Events agreed at an earlier stage so we can recover the Fixed Price Risk – as opposed to agreeing CE’s after the work has been completed and NG excluding the fee for risk. Compensation Events are generally not agreed on time. Use of Bog mats underneath cabins as a substitute to a hard standing area. Look in to the site establishment costs more closely i.e. the cost implications of having bog mats under the cabins for the contract duration as opposed to extra Type 1 etc. (NG will not accept paying for bogmats under cabins as deemed to be included in our site set up costs). When undertaking the Extended PC Role, try to ensure there is a Murphy representative on site as often as possible even if they are working on other projects as their time can be recovered through the PMI. Issue CE quotations as soon as EWN has been submitted and avoid waiting on PMI’s from client which delays the process and often the works have been carried out by the time the CE is agreed. Try to get CE’s agreed and signed off as early as possible to improve cash flow on the project. (This is really driven by NG’s refusal to agree and sign off CE’s in advance of the works.) Do not use bog mats under site cabins. Preferred use of sustainable Jack pads....now happening. Make sure there is a PC rep on site at all times."
Consider fully before building elements for other ISS projects such as high transport costs and future design changes
"Gate Detail, lack of anti-burrow cill across road as show on approved construction drawings. Precast option for base of draw-boxes. Use of pole float to finish blinding. A early TQ of the proposed design to avoid stoppages during the programmed works. To be adopted on future projects, as reduces time excavations open as well as construction time. To be adopted on future projects as saves on labour and time."
Sub-contractor with no experience of working in a NG environment. RAMS. Sub-contractor to put forward CV’s as part of the competency record which will be used as part of the SMS. Full list of RAMS to be developed including sub contractors RAMS before job starts. And entered into master register as a reminder/requirement.
Only 2 programmes were agreed for the job. SC1 completion was 1 no. week late. Mobilisation of work force to start work before part C was in place. EWN & CE to be inserted onto programme/ EWN/CE to have programme extract attached on submission. Hold meeting with client planner at regular intervals to insure signing off of latest programme. Identify critical programme path at inaugural construction meeting. (Gate re[1]work was driven by Chubb but site team could have sent off gate sooner without PMI from the client as the gates were a programme critical issue. To lay off site labour until such time that all design deliverables are in place. Planner to be more proactive in enabling this.
"Housekeeping. Toolbox Talks and Take Fives. RAMS. Culture change programme could have more visible on site from the outset. Two men tasked to look after housekeeping. Carried out every morning, worked well. Full list of RAMS to be developed including sub contractors RAMS before job starts. As above. Ensure culture change programme is integrated in management duties."
Environmental team very proactive and visible on job. Waste streams and hardcore were managed well on completion. The hardcore was given to a local farmer. Keep/maintain this process. Continue practice.
"Installation was to a high standard. All elements of the final product were well received. Site Establishment area cutting up over time generally leaving a poor impression of the site. Water-logging of certain parts of the site establishment. On completion of job, it was difficult to manage remaining crews i.e no continuity. A no snagging list at the end was approached by the site Foreman and greatly assisted in a smooth transition to the end of the project with snagging taking up 1 no. day. Sample load of recycled matieral to be sent to site to judge quality before. Investigate if type 1 hardcore is as cost effective with the supplier. Investigate if de-watering of the compound is a risk. Management of works streams and other projects better – very difficult if no work instantly available."
"Failure to attend training; Individual’s stating that they are unaware of a training event date and then missing the training course. Lack of pre course preparation. Individual’s are not taking the time to familiarise themselves with course pre reading and then failing or not attempting elements of training due to the lack of preparation on their part. Being more proactive. Individual’s making themselves available at very short notice to attend a training course. Competence. When an individual is first taken on in employment, they should provide a CV. The CV can be reviewed in line with the individual’s PDR thereby keeping it up-to-date and is reviewed at least annually. This CV should also be backed up with the training certification which should also be in date. The CV is used to create the Competence Assessment to validate that the individual is fit for role or that a gap analysis has been undertaken that the individual can be employed “at risk” until the training has been successfully completed."
Providing fresh drinking water. Consider some sort of small water cooling/ filtration system to provide fresh drinking water.
"Office space for visitors to site. Extra hot-desks to be provided, to avoid people working on the project having to move to the closest project to find a desk."
"Satellite system for IT. Lack of effective use of F drive. More modern approach to temp broadband. Future Jobs should where possible should install a broadband line, to save time upload items onto F drive and general day to day workings. Forge better habits in use of F drive. Use of dongles in lieu of cumbersome satellite."
"Received a score of 7 and above for each element of the JMS client feedback form for the project Continue to identify, develop and manage client expectations."
"During construction progress generally good but failed to formally hand over completed zones (8no). Access to areas delayed from other contractors. Though areas were completed, they were not formally handed over to tech partner/NG as per programme milestnes, Tech partner did access areas as schedule but as not officially handed over - resulted in multiple revisits snagging etc. Due to delays 13week EOT awarded to contract."
Documented internal meetings which commenced at the start of the project did not continue throughout the project however communication between the site management team was good. JMS attitude worked well with what can be a restrictive conditions (large substation). The documented meeting is an essential internal tool to raise areas of concern for the project and if administered correctly would aid the management of the project as a whole. JMS positive approach enabled good relations with the permit issuer – which is rare on substations and enabled work to proceed generally as per programme.
Project redesigned a number of times as instructed by NG. But similar to other ISS framework projects details in some locations were lacking. Far too many DCNs generated during construction based on a less than detailed design. Despite above DCN managed well. More diligence required in challenging designer proposals. Designer need to be placed into a more binding contract to enable them to take more responsibility of the design during construction REPEAT OFFENCE ON ISS PROJECTS AND NEED SERIOUS REVIEW ON NEXT FRAMEWORK. Not sign off on generic details in design if not detailed enough to construct AS ABOVE. Robust system in place to identify change and stood the test of numerous audits.
Temporary works design in place for all activities . System / process subject of NG audits - all good.
At times more direct operatives could have been utilised on the project but difficult due to the substation training requirement. Later end of project with many staff leavers project under resourced management wise. To get Persons and Besc training from NG it required a 6 -8 week turnaround to get the training as it had to be paid up front. The problem was on JMS site with payments. Due to this long lead time labour only subbies were used more that should have been as it took too long for our own employees to get trained up etc. Contingent/hired in QS utilised which should be avoided if possible.
“Prolec” programmable height restrictors fitted to excavators/telehandlers Mostly JMS plant utilised. This software worked very well and client really like – became a standard.
No major issues. Use of TVCBs worked well though initially NG triaed to enforce insitu concrete specs on a precast item. But through various audits JMS proved /eliminated NG concerns.
Ascot doors used for hardening and door installation. Steelway fro build hardening. Would recommend. Would recommend.
"All DCNs managed well. Required to use hired in QS. 13 week EOT awarded. As per NG/JMS procedures, though too many. If a direct employee would have worked out cheaper and probably would have coverd other site too."
Due to lack of management resources towards end of project close out of snag issues protracted. Failed to carry out FAT tests of automated gates. Snaggging not closed out quick enough during construction as mentioned above resulted in some – ve QOBs/ issues need to be tackled promptly. Resulted in protracted site witness tests and repeat visits by supplier and –ve QOBs NOT TO BE REPEATED on future ISS framework.
"No major accidents or incidents. JMS drafted an Earthing management Plan. Direct work force works well on NG framework project with good attitudes to work, H&S&W. This document became a benchmark for NG on other no JMS sites and provided good feedback."
All waste streams managed well . All timber waste diverted to charities. As with all ISS sites to be repeated.
"When we were delayed with the handing-over of the Client’s free-issue materials, the employer was in denial that it was having an impact on costs and programme as we were ‘still welding’. Whilst we were welding we were working inefficiently and out of sequence. The Client referred to the programme to ask us to demonstrate the reason for the delay. The logic in the tender programme was not robust enough to demonstrate our true entitlement. During the construction phase, there were many issues (out of the control of the Murphy Project team) that caused a threat to the delivery of the project within the programme. The two issues that had the largest impact were the discovery of 16 different unidentified buried services within the footprint of the proposed site, and the late delivery of the employer’s free-issue permanent materials. Despite the many man hours of extra works involved in sorting these issues, Murphy overcame all problems and limited the impact to a two week delay on the programme. Although there are still ongoing issues with the recovery of costs associated with these works, the Client has on more than one occasion commented that any subcontractor other than Murphy would have taken much longer to adapt and resolve these problems and would not have been so proactive in sorting issues that were at the Client’s expense. Unfortunately the above has caused commercial issues as the Clients would not agree CEs (nor revised programmes). Meanwhile we were mitigating the effects of the delays by maintaining labour forces for longer. On most projects with National Grid under the NEC, once the EWNs are submitted a CE is agreed, we revise our programme and move on. This particular Client team were completely in denial that their delays were affecting the works and the tactic of requesting for programmes to be re-submitted to include previous logic was a strategy for them to buy themselves time whilst we continued to mitigate. One of the current outstanding issues regarding compensation events is that the Client was not made aware of the resources required to resolve their issues at the time of the works. This is now resulting in disagreements of costs after Murphy has completed the works. Murphy were restricted to the milestone completion dates stated by the employer in the Works Information and we were not in a position to programme the works to suit an efficient build. A large cost saving could have been achieved by Murphy in utilising less resources for longer durations. The majority of the early civil works were carried out between November and March when the weather is the least forgiving.  On the Tender Programme, ensure that the programme ‘logic’ is correctly linked to maximise impact including (as the impact normally does) the follow-on activities ie. Civils, EC&I and often end date. During the initial tender and design meetings, we must try to ensure the Client has carried out extensive investigation and site surveys. Work with the Client to resolve problems and reduce delays even when it is their responsibility. This will ensure that relationships and Murphy reputation for getting the job done is maintained. Try and cascade the commercial issues to senior management earlier in the project Ensure a ‘no surprises approach’. Agree with the client what resources will be brought to site to try to resolve their problem before they are mobilised. Provide the client with a resourced and costed plan of action as soon as practicably possible. Something to consider on future projects similar to Eakring - Challenge the Client’s motives for starting a project in Winter. Advise him of the benefits of starting construction from later on in the year eg March."
"This project was designed by Mott McDonald on behalf of National Grid. The design was completed before Murphy was awarded the contract, resulting in no Murphy input in to the design. Drawing control worked well even though the project only had a part-time document controller and they were not based on site. The document controller maintained all registers and the site team issued the drawings as per their instructions. Encourage the Client to allow early Contractor involvement in the design. Good quality staff and good communication and liaison pays dividends."
"Temporary works went well on this project despite a few misunderstandings with the Client’s safety representative This was used when above and below ground slabs were too close together to safely support the top slab whilst the lower was excavated. At Eakring we designed a number of concrete retaining walls to underpin the top slab while creating a maintenance free excavation wall to the lower. These were relatively cheap and easy to construct by excavating a slip trench and flooding it with C50 concrete, using the unexcavated ground as formwork. Additionally, the Murphy’s estimate had made provision for this due to the link between construction and estimating during the tender stage. It is a mistake to allow a Client to determine what they feel is an adequate level of design or control of temporary works. As a competent contractor we have far more experience in dealing with temporary works, so it is important to stick to our procedures. After being challenged on a number of TW designs we took these issues to a higher level within National Grid and, when resolved, we were proved to be in conformance in the first place. Good forward planning. Construction personnel having input into tender process is useful. Note: The bigger picture however, for a Lessons Learned, is that the designer should have been thinking about temporary works during the design phase."
"Due to the low contract value of this project, staffing levels were kept to a minimum and mainly part-time to save costs. The staff consisted of: § Project Manager (part-time) § Safety Advisor § Construction Manager § Document Controller (part-time) § Environmental Advisor(2 days a month) § QS (part-time) § Engineer. Although everything was kept under control by the three full[1]time staff, it would have been very beneficial to have utilised an admin person. A lot of time was consumed by printing and issuing drawings, procedures, works instructions, timesheets, lodge forms and running documentation between the Client and Document Control as doc control was not based on site. Despite only having three full time staff and often having to have an involvement in areas that would not usually be the concerns of safety, construction or engineering staff, it actually made things more straightforward to deal with everything on our own rather than going through the long drawn out channels usually associated with “inflated” project teams. Although they were not part of the Project team, the Ollerton staff was a huge help to this project and were only too happy to help where they could. Ensure that projects are adequately resourced. It may be prudent to utilise an admin person to take care of simple, sometimes time[1]consuming tasks, whilst releasing others to concentrate on the more specialist activities. Project teams correctly scaled to the requirements of the project. Maintain good relationships with other parts of your business unit."
"At the start of the project all Plant hire was dealt with through London Plant Department; this was one of the worst communication breakdowns on the project. Almost all plant was hired externally. After two months the project switched to using the Ollerton plant dept for plant hire, this was very efficient and 95% of all plant hired was internal. Even items we had from external would be exchanged / returned as soon as Murphy equipment was available. Some of the equipment supplied from Ollerton was older equipment and prone to breakdowns. Plant rates need to be agreed at the time of tender to ensure that a robust price is tendered. Some of the internal plant charges were higher than the estimate. For service and repairs of plant Ollerton were quick and efficient in sorting any issues we had and reduced down time. Make full use of your own business unit. Constant review of hired plant ensures the most cost efficient working. JMS should review the viability of some items of older plant. Internal plant rates should be reviewed across the Group and should be competitive; multiple rates for equipment should be abolished. A good working relationship with Plant Hire is essential. Good forward planning pays. Good communication with the stores and regional yards ensures efficiencies. Buying department could have extended hours cover (07:00- 09:00). A versatile workforce is essential on small projects."
"All materials were ordered on time and lead times were never an issue for all the civil and mechanical items that Murphy supplied. A big effort was made on this project to make use of left over materials from previous projects; this included all the drainage, ducting, geo-textile, paint MCL and some timber and welding consumables. If circumstances change and materials are required quickly, it can be frustrating when items are delayed being ordered because they require sign-off from London. A full-time storeman was not required once the free issue permanent mechanical materials arrived. For the remaining part of the project we utilised a HGV driver who fulfilled the role of storeman. He kept track of stores and stock and this worked well. It did need some managing however in controlling COSHH correctly. Good forward planning pays. Good communication with the stores and regional yards ensures efficiencies. Buying department could have extended hours cover (07:00- 09:00). A versatile workforce is essential on small projects."
"All subcontract purchasing was dealt with very efficiently by Murphy and all well in advance of works starting. All subcontractors maintained an excellent Health and Safety, Quality and Environmental performance on this project. Nexus Power - excellent subcontractor and very efficient in resolving the problems we had with the unknown services. Very professional and prompt with regard to RAMS and their approach to safety. Electrafence Limited – supplied perimeter fencing, although they have been very reliable on previous projects, we had a lack of input from their management during this project and there were some quality issues during construction. Maintain good foreword planning. For all subcontractors we insisted that they attend a pre-start meeting to ensure that all H&S, quality and environmental issues were resolved before contract award/ commence works. Ensure subcontractor feedback questionnaires are completed to ensure other Project Management Teams are aware of the good ones. Historical performance is not always a guarantee to future performance."
"As mentioned in the Programme section, this project had the construction programme reduced by two months before construction had started (cut and fill and site clearance). This made planning of works in the short time scales difficult to do efficiently. There were 43 Early Warnings generated on the project. The Client was continuously disputing the CEs and we did not get enough of the CEs agreed. Meanwhile we ended up mitigating the effects of the delays. There were a number of items that the Client asked for us to complete that were variations to the contract. As we are always trying to please the Client and progress the works, we just carried out these tasks. It was not until later it was noted that these items were not in the original scope and the Client would not pay for them. This, compounded by late delivery of Client-supplied materials, lead to inefficient working. This is very hard to put a cost to or prove to the Client. Try and ensure a no surprises approach. Agree with the Client what resources will be brought to site to try to resolve the problem before they are mobilised. Provide the Client with a resourced and costed plan of action as soon as practicably possible. The project team should have made more efforts to understand the information that was made aware to the tender team before construction commenced. The result of this is that some works that were not necessarily allowed for were completed for free."
"No quality non conformances were issued on this project, although two negative observations were raised (one relating to Materials issued by MPEP auditor, and one issued by NG relating to coatings). Murphy have had many good comments from the Client and other visitors about the high standards of the quality on the complete job. The welding department had a huge input in the early works at Eakring and their professional approach made the Client’s team look second- class. Ensure quality remains at the forefront. The reality is that most AGIs we build are never seen again however this one will always be on show and will be used weekly by National Grid for many years. The publicity that this provides Murphy is vast and is a testimony of our skills in delivering these complex projects."
The welfare facilities at Eakring were moderate but sufficient. Due to the low contract value it was important to keep all costs to a minimum. Traffic management was very well controlled on this project by producing a route map and PPE requirements flyer and issuing it to all suppliers when orders were placed .We had a visit from the HSE during construction and we received great feedback regarding the high standards we were maintaining.
"There were no issues with the control of environmental mitigation on this project despite having a part-time Environmental team member. Time management was good with audits being planned to coincide with Client’s audit We made agreements with the adjacent landowner at Eakring to use the left over clay to infill a small section of land that they had previously not been able to use, and the surplus stone from our yard to construct a hard standing area. This made a huge saving on taking materials off site and also gave us a great reputation with the local landowner. Good communications with client Environmental representative. Good forward planning. Always look for areas to save money as the Tender would have made provision for an element of muck-away."
"This design was produced by others with numerous flaws (56 DCN issued during construction of the project) which resulted in programme delays and cost over-runs. Late in the project the poor design delayed final completion of works by 2 weeks due to the discovery of unknown services. The service routes were suspected but the location was overlooked by the site team when planning trial hole investigative works. The General Arrangement drawing for site is overlaid over a previous as-built, but for some reason the scales were different. As a result the co-ordinates provided for the ISS building and camera tower 31 were wrong. These items required DCNs to confirm positions put forward by the site team. Design for the rapidstack chambers with concrete surround has a straight edge which looks poor. Barton Stacey’s concrete finisher put a bull-nose trowel edge which provides a smoother more aesthetically pleasing finish. The sliding gate motors were designed to be earthed to the fence. NG removed the fence earthing requirement which left the gates requiring an alternative source of earth. When costing and programming 3rd party design ensure investigative works have been done and that the design is fit for purpose. Constant review of design and the impact upon existing known or suspected services to allow timely identification of issues that may arise. In future check with the Design team that the CAD drawing has been correctly overlaid on any previous drawings. Site Engineer / Design Co[1]ordinator to check designs going forward. If we encounter this design again we should propose the bull-nose finish to concrete surround. On future sites we need to ensure design takes the lack of fence earth into account or we need to mitigate our costs in the scope and at tender stage."
"High level of communication between all members of the site management team resulting in quick and efficient problem resolution, great working relationships and a positive working environment in general. Good mix of long term experienced employees and younger less experienced newcomers. Several members of the Project Team kept track of lessons learned throughout the project, making completing this exercise easier and more meaningful. Large GAs of the site were displayed on walls of the offices. This meant people could easily identify what colleagues were referring to. Many Foremen filled in very detailed Allocation Sheets. Some Foremen filled in Allocation Sheets with less detail than required. A new starter to Murphy had to leave the Site Offices after three weeks due to having previously worked as a Representative of the Client. The Lockerley and nearby Barton Stacey Site Management Teams co-operated closely, often pooling labour and resources and finding common solutions to issues to aid progress. The Murphy Site Management Team worked together and helped out when people were on leave, in preparation for Board Visits etc. Excellent working relationships were maintained and high levels of communication occurred between the Murphy Site Management Team and the sub contractors of our Technology Partner, Siemens. This lead to a more integrated approach to sequencing work and helped to mitigate against delays. Keep up the good work of employing team players with can do attitudes and reward them for their hard work and efforts. Promote and encourage the idea of experienced operatives working with less experienced operatives in order to pass on their knowledge, allowing them to gain confidence and in turn help them to become a valued member of the team. Such list of lessons learned should be maintained on all projects to better aid the distribution of lessons. This practice should be repeated on all projects to aid clarity. This practise should be encouraged. This practise should be discouraged and the importance of Allocation Sheets reinforced. Ensure such new starters are contractually permitted to work on projects. Where projects are geographically close to each other such co-operation such be promoted. This helpful attitude is widespread in Murphy and should be encouraged. Such working relationships should be established at the start of projects and maintained throughout the duration."
"Compensation Event quotations were not issued in a timely manner on the back of EWN’s making it more difficult later on in the project to agree costs and time implications. There was not enough interaction between the Project Planner and Commercial Team to identify where slippages in the programme could be attributed to. Use of bog mats underneath cabins as opposed to concrete pads / Type 1 is not a financially viable solution as there are on-going weekly charges for bog mats throughout the duration of the projects as opposed to ‘one-off’ payment for other options. Site personnel (from both Client and Murphy) had different names for building to the Contract Documents and Drawings, e.g. UPS/ISS Building. This has the potential to lead to difficulties further down the line when references in the Minutes of Meetings do not match the Contract Documents, though this did not happen on this project. Client’s Commercial Representative did not have construction experience nor have a good understanding of how construction activities are carried out (unrealistic concepts regarding scheduling, resourcing, disruption mitigation measures etc.) This resulted in it being rather difficult to agree CEs and much time was spent explaining simple concepts. Client’s Commercial Representative was usually only on site once per week for the Progress Meeting and rarely walked around the site. This meant that Client decisions were made using second-hand information from other NG Representatives. Early Warnings could have been impacted on to the programme quicker to force NG to agree CEs. Agreement of CEs left to the end of the project by NG despite attempts by JMS to close more quickly. All the Murphy Site Management Team gave their time freely when helping with EWNs, CE quotes, etc. which was much appreciated. The NEC Training held near the start of the project was very useful in focusing people’s attention on the importance of keeping accurate records etc. Issue CE quotations as soon as the EWN has been raised even if a PMI is not forthcoming from the client. Ensure that all CE’s are accompanied by impacted programmes to determine if there is any affect on critical path items. The Project Planner and Commercial Team should meet at a minimum once a month to analyse the monthly updated programme and if there are slippages from the previous month, and identify possible EWN’s/CE’s to pursue. Consider site establishment costs more closely, i.e. cost implications of hiring bog mats for the contract period over extra Type 1 etc. during site establishment. Murphy personnel should encourage Client personnel to use consistent terminology. This is out of the hands of Murphy. The best approach is to deal with the situation patiently. The amount of time the Client’s Commercial Representative is on site is out of Murphy’s hands, but they should be encouraged to walk around site regularly to gain a true appreciation of the activities that are taking place on site. EW / CE to be impacted onto programme as the project progresses. Appropriate NEC Training should be given to all Murphy Site Management personnel."
"Jacksons supplied sliding gates which were not wired to NG specification (EL5) due to Jacksons not having been issued the spec by JMS. Delivery of non-compliant, non-specified plant and materials to site. Procurement of different brands/types of a similar product to be used on site resulted in many hours wasted producing COSHH assessments for each type, during which time the products must be placed in quarantine and are unusable on site. Hiab was requisitioned to lift a 6T concrete base, but the Hiab that arrived could only lift 4T. This cost us two days’ productivity. The wind posts for the UPS Building required separate attachments to connect to roof. Perforated pipe, terram and tie wraps were purchased separately for a new French Drain and manually put together on-site. This was very time consuming. A geotextile sock could have been purchased instead, which would have saved considerable time and out[1]weighed the slightly higher cost of the terram socks. Jacksons fence and gate manufacturers provided delivery notes and invoices that did bear any resemblance to the items on our Purchase Order (e.g. gates were detailed by every component part and thus indistinguishable from other items such as fence panels, bolts etc.) This resulted in much time being lost sifting through the delivery tickets to match them with our Purchase Order. This was compounded by the fact that Jacksons had to return several items they had damaged in transit to our site – when the repaired items were delivered to site they were not highlighted and mixed with new materials being brought to site. Requisition/procurement of certain items such as doors, locks, gates should include for 2 year warranty, as warranty starts from end of installation however, and our warranty to Client does not start until the DBs are accepted. When procuring materials, equipment or subcontractors ensure all relevant documentation is issued with the order when placed. When ordering plant and materials for these sites due to their nature normal compliant items may not be acceptable. When ordering plant or materials either internally or from external suppliers ensure a detailed description of the specification is included. Stores & Procurement team should work closely to agree a list of approved brands/types of product and ensure that only these items are ordered. Others should be ordered as a last resort. Plant Depots should supply items that were requisitioned. If they cannot supply the required plant the site should be notified. Stores & Procurement team should be fully aware of requirements such as connections. Where such perforated French Drains are required in future terram socks should be purchased. Suppliers should be instructed to list items on invoices clearly referencing our Purchase Order items before we process their payments. Future projects."
"Some Operatives were put through training which allowed them to hold permits, with the associated financial and time costs to Murphy. However, they then refused to hold these permits when on-site. This resulted in Engineer’s time being lost holding permits and monitoring activities when the Operatives could have held the permits and the Engineer’s time being spent more productively. Trial holes dug early days in the project when surveying equipment had yet to be acquired, and the Engineer was on 4-day course. A lot of time was wasted setting out cill and camera base excavations with a total station, and this required an engineer and a chainboy. After a period of time it was noticed by the Engineering Manager that the site engineer was spending a lot of time setting out excavations and that a large project like this justified the need for a GPS. The introduction of the GPS increased the speed of setting out and freed up one engineer to concentrate on other works. The GPS also made survey and as-built record keeping much more efficient. A top of the range Leica Total Station was initially hired from SCCS Hire. This was later replaced by a Murphy[1]owned older model. It was noticed however that the Murphy hired machine had a higher weekly hire cost than the more modern hired machine. Only one engineer employed during the early days of the project. Ensure Operatives carry out the duties required of them after they receive the appropriate training. If they require further training or assistance this should be provided, but the responsibility should ultimately lie where it is best suited. Prior to any trial holes being dug, the Engineer needs to have, as a minimum, a total station or ideally a GPS unit. In order for these to work they need to have a minimum of three known points and levels. A Murphy Surveyor did put in control points, but not early enough. Assess the size of the project, the time that will be required to carry out setting and discuss with management if a GPS unit is required. Re-assess the rates charged for Ollerton survey equipment. It was noticed that there was a significant workload for one engineer and a second engineer was drafted in during the initial busy period. A graduate engineer was employed for the duration of the project."
"Bricklayers deviated from the drawings of the ISS/UPS Building. This led to the potential for the deviations to be rectified at Murphy’s expense. Subcontractor Herbicide operatives arrived at site without competencies / training records and with banned items in their van resulting in these subcontractors, already completing their induction, being sent off site. Ascot Doors were extremely slow in providing certification for the doors installed. Close monitoring of subcontractors is required, within the limitations of the Site Management allocated to project. Before any Subcontractor is awarded work all NG rules and requirements, Murphy site procedures and any information which is required ie. COSHH assessments/ method statements and competencies should be outlined to them which would ensure when they arrive to site they can get on with work that needs to be done. Ascot and other subcontractors need to be made aware of our requirements regarding certification prior to works commencing."
"Client pressured us to reduce the contract programme – effectively removed our float. This put alot of strain on the site management team to deliver the project in the time-frame agreed. This also put pressure on us to deliver long-lead items by the Milestone dates. On some occasions key Operatives and Permit Holders were temporarily moved to different projects at very short notice. This had a negative impact on progress on the project. We occasionally accepted Operatives that were “Looking for a home” which resulted in us having too many Operatives. This did not have a proportionate increase in productivity as Operatives who were busy were de-motivated by seeing Operatives with little to do. At Murphy Long Weekends several Operatives repeatedly left very early the day before the day off. Different people leaving at different times often resulted in a significant negative impact on these days. Try and persuade Client to agree to a realistic programme. Where key Operatives and Permit Holders have to be moved as much notice as possible should be given to Site Management to allow the impact to be minimised to as little as possible. The allocation of Operatives when there is little work is always difficult. Site Management Teams should be given as much notice as possible in order to plan for and prepare additional activities for the extra Operatives. Where Operatives are paid for a full day they should work to, or very close to, a full day, even before a long weekend. If they wish to leave early they should get paid accordingly to reflect the disruption to progress."
A pre-start meeting should be held to clarify items such as this. If their H&S Advisors do have an area of concern they must report it to Murphy Project Manager or Murphy H&S Advisor
"Arrangements are in place with the landowner next to the site to take stone from haul roads and hard standing, this makes a substantial saving as this would have been costly to dispose of off site, which also cuts down in transport costs, carbon emissions and addresses to waste hierarchy(reduce, reuse, recycle). Use of community wood recycling group to take away waste wood instead of using a skip. This initiative is cheaper than using a skip, more wood can be fit per load meaning cutting down on transport. The scheme also aims to reuse as much wood as practicable instead of just chipping it, again addressing the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle). The Technical Partner’s waste arrangements need to be looked into and agreed before they arrive on site. This was an ongoing issue and was difficult to resolve. The re-profiling of the southern elevation meant no spoil from excavations was sent off site, saving a significant amount of money, also saving what would have been a massive amount of wagon movements. Early on in the project it was noted that the main generator that was being used was highly inefficient and using up 400 litres of diesel per day. This was quickly exchanged for a more efficient generator. Good planning and communication, all necessary paper work obtained from the Environment Agency. Good relationship maintained with local community. At the start of any new project look into using this scheme instead of getting a wood skip. Technical partner to provide their own waste facilities or a clear agreement to be made before the job kicks off. Where possible look into agreeing this as an option for eliminating this waste stream on further projects. Monitoring diesel usage at this early stage has potentially saved a substantial cost, and emissions were reduced with the new generator."
"A Best Practice was submitted before being passed by other members of the business unit resulting in unsuitable BPs being implemented. At the start of the project our Technology Partner stated that they wanted Murphy to issue them with permits to work in our CDM area, even though this is not included in any Contract Documentation. This had the potential to cause serious delays and costs at our liability (ie. they could stand around waiting for permits and then put in a claim.) Due to the experience of the Site Manager this situation was averted and we refuted any need to issue permits. All best practice submissions should be issued to Managers / Engineers H&S Advisors for feedback before submission to NG. All site management need to be aware of such potential situations – be aware of the Contract Documentation and think about possible ulterior motives of Technology Partners."
"Unsuitable operatives being given training to meet site requirements. Issues with tracking the competencies of Operatives – the current Murphy database is very static. Operatives being selected for training should be carefully considered, taking into account their attitude, abilities and future plans within the company to avoid wasted time and money as well as to ensure competent personnel with positive attitudes are given every opportunity to progress. A more dynamic system could be introduced, for example by sending an alert to the H&S Advisor if an item of an Operative’s training is about to expire."
"Toilets not being maintained due to the high level of personnel on site. The cess pit cover located adjacent to the canteen / office entrance, resulting in a disgusting smell throughout both locations three times a week whilst being emptied (more often than not, this would take place during breakfast / lunch period whilst personnel are eating). Projects which exceed a certain number of personnel should employ a person to look after the cleaning and maintenance of toilets. Think about the location of the cess pit cover at the design stage of the job, possibly locating it away from the canteen. If not, try to arrange the emptying of the tank to take place at suitable times (early morning, late afternoon)."
Offices were very warm in the summer and the air conditioning was disconnected. Supply air conditioning or fans with the offices.
"Length of time it takes to have an IT issue resolved is far too long and more often than not involves chasing up the IT department for several days before achieving the required results. Insufficient number of telephone lines was installed at the start of the project. This lead to long delays waiting for a line to become available. Servicing of the generator and cable testing caused malfunctions with our internet and telephone router. Printer malfunctioned twice due to the dust in the summer. This is likely because the printer, which is fine for regular offices, is not robust enough for site offices. This caused major disruption to the Site Management as we could not print, photocopy or scan documents. Long lead-in for temporary and permanent internet connection. This caused major disruption to site management. Electricians carrying out testing blew the plug on the internet and telephone router, causing significant disruption until a replacement was sourced and installed. Once all the initial difficulties were resolved and the permanent internet connection was installed the connection was usually very fast and consistent. Seek and implement an effective solution to this perennial problem. To reduce the potential for this to be repeated we installed a surge protector and 20 minute back up. Perhaps electricians should check that one is in place before testing in future. Installation of a permanent internet connection should be prioritised for site offices."
"Client dictating to members of the site management team eg. insisting on Murphy safety alerts being produced to reflect well on NG rather than to reflect the actual facts. An amicable relationship was maintained with all Client representatives throughout the project, despite some difficulties posed by some representatives. JMS senior management should be made aware of this type of behaviour so they can decide if it is in Murphy’s best interest to allow this Client practice to continue. Good relations should be built from the start with all external parties on a project."

This had a negative impact on progress on the project. We occasionally accepted Operatives that were “Looking for a home” which resulted in us having too many Operatives. This did not have a proportionate increase in productivity as Operatives who were busy were de-motivated by seeing Operatives with little to do. At Murphy Long Weekends several Operatives repeatedly left very early the day before the day off. Different people leaving at different times often resulted in a significant negative impact on these days. Try and persuade Client to agree to a realistic programme. Where key Operatives and Permit Holders have to be moved as much notice as possible should be given to Site Management to allow the impact to be minimised to as little as possible. The allocation of Operatives when there is little work is always difficult. Site Management Teams should be given as much notice as possible in order to plan for and prepare additional activities for the extra Operatives. Where Operatives are paid for a full day they should work to, or very close to, a full day, even before a long weekend. If they wish to leave early they should get paid accordingly to reflect the disruption to progress."
"H&S advisors wasting too much time carrying out repetitive tasks on site in order to please the NG and meet their unattainable expectations. JMS and external contractors gaining access to site with PPE which doesn’t meet the required standards and/or vehicles which contain banned items etc. H&S Advisors being held accountable for the actions of operatives on site when in reality, the operatives are all deemed to be competent and should take responsibility for their own actions. At the start of the project the H&S Advisor of our Technology Partner were giving Murphy employees instructions. This was often conflicting with the Murphy Daily Briefings and led to some confusion. The H&S Advisor of our Technology Partner was asked to refrain from instructing Murphy personnel and our employees were advised of the facts of the situation. Include vehicle inspections and PPE inspection as part of the site induction with a zero tolerance approach. Also H&S advisors should carry out regular vehicle / PPE inspections throughout life of the project. Prior to contractors working on our projects, they should all be made aware of our expectations and arrive to site fully prepared and compliant. Site supervisors should be reminded of their duties and play a more active role in enforcing safety / site rules. Site Supervisors are responsible for monitoring safety compliance, but Operatives should also be held responsible when they deliberately break H&S rules when they have received the correct training and briefings. H&S advisors are not here to supervise. A pre-start meeting should be held to clarify items such as this. If their H&S Advisors do have an area of concern they must report it to Murphy Project Manager or Murphy H&S Advisor."
"Arrangements are in place with the landowner next to the site to take stone from haul roads and hard standing, this makes a substantial saving as this would have been costly to dispose of off site, which also cuts down in transport costs, carbon emissions and addresses to waste hierarchy(reduce, reuse, recycle). Use of community wood recycling group to take away waste wood instead of using a skip. This initiative is cheaper than using a skip, more wood can be fit per load meaning cutting down on transport. The scheme also aims to reuse as much wood as practicable instead of just chipping it, again addressing the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle). Use of community wood recycling group to take away waste wood instead of using a skip. This initiative is cheaper than using a skip, more wood can be fit per load meaning cutting down on transport. The scheme also aims to reuse as much wood as practicable instead of just chipping it, again addressing the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle The Technical Partner’s waste arrangements need to be looked into and agreed before they arrive on site. This was an ongoing issue and was difficult to resolve. The re-profiling of the southern elevation meant no spoil from excavations was sent off site, saving a significant amount of money, also saving what would have been a massive amount of wagon movements. Early on in the project it was noted that the main generator that was being used was highly inefficient and using up 400 litres of diesel per day. This was quickly exchanged for a more efficient generator. Good planning and communication, all necessary paper work obtained from the Environment Agency. Good relationship maintained with local community. At the start of any new project look into using this scheme instead of getting a wood skip. Technical partner to provide their own waste facilities or a clear agreement to be made before the job kicks off. Where possible look into agreeing this as an option for eliminating this waste stream on further projects. Monitoring diesel usage at this early stage has potentially saved a substantial cost, and emissions were reduced with the new generator."
"A Best Practice was submitted before being passed by other members of the business unit resulting in unsuitable BPs being implemented. At the start of the project our Technology Partner stated that they wanted Murphy to issue them with permits to work in our CDM area, even though this is not included in any Contract Documentation. This had the potential to cause serious delays and costs at our liability (ie. they could stand around waiting for permits and then put in a claim.) Due to the experience of the Site Manager this situation was averted and we refuted any need to issue permits. All best practice submissions should be issued to Managers / Engineers H&S Advisors for feedback before submission to NG. All site management need to be aware of such potential situations – be aware of the Contract Documentation and think about possible ulterior motives of Technology Partners."
"Unsuitable operatives being given training to meet site requirements. Issues with tracking the competencies of Operatives – the current Murphy database is very static. Operatives being selected for training should be carefully considered, taking into account their attitude, abilities and future plans within the company to avoid wasted time and money as well as to ensure competent personnel with positive attitudes are given every opportunity to progress. A more dynamic system could be introduced, for example by sending an alert to the H&S Advisor if an item of an Operative’s training is about to expire."
"Toilets not being maintained due to the high level of personnel on site. The cess pit cover located adjacent to the canteen / office entrance, resulting in a disgusting smell throughout both locations three times a week whilst being emptied (more often than not, this would take place during breakfast / lunch period whilst personnel are eating). Operatives being selected for training should be carefully considered, taking into account their attitude, abilities and future plans within the company to avoid wasted time and money as well as to ensure competent personnel with positive attitudes are given every opportunity to progress. A more dynamic system could be introduced, for example by sending an alert to the H&S Advisor if an item of an Operative’s training is about to expire."
Offices were very warm in the summer and the air conditioning was disconnected. Supply air conditioning or fans with the offices.
"Length of time it takes to have an IT issue resolved is far too long and more often than not involves chasing up the IT department for several days before achieving the required results. Insufficient number of telephone lines was installed at the start of the project. This lead to long delays waiting for a line to become available. Servicing of the generator and cable testing caused malfunctions with our internet and telephone router. Printer malfunctioned twice due to the dust in the summer. This is likely because the printer, which is fine for regular offices, is not robust enough for site offices. This caused major disruption to the Site Management as we could not print, photocopy or scan documents. Long lead-in for temporary and permanent internet connection. This caused major disruption to site management. Electricians carrying out testing blew the plug on the internet and telephone router, causing significant disruption until a replacement was sourced and installed. Once all the initial difficulties were resolved and the permanent internet connection was installed the connection was usually very fast and consistent. Seek and implement an effective solution to this perennial problem. To reduce the potential for this to be repeated we installed a surge protector and 20 minute back up. Perhaps electricians should check that one is in place before testing in future. Installation of a permanent internet connection should be prioritised for site offices."
"Client dictating to members of the site management team eg. insisting on Murphy safety alerts being produced to reflect well on NG rather than to reflect the actual facts. An amicable relationship was maintained with all Client representatives throughout the project, despite some difficulties posed by some representatives. JMS senior management should be made aware of this type of behaviour so they can decide if it is in Murphy’s best interest to allow this Client practice to continue. Good relations should be built from the start with all external parties on a project."
"Adopted Design from Galliford Try resulted in numerous DCNs during construction and consequently delays to project completion. At times, there was poor communication of details to site operatives resulting in incorrect details ie. required concrete finish / ISS building details. In some instances, DCN control was poor and work was being carried out prior to DC approval. Further allowance on cost and time should situation be repeated. A comprehensive briefing of each building element to be briefed by the Engineer to work crews so that full understanding of actual requirements is met. Future sites ensure full compliance to project requirements."
"The Barton Stacey and nearby Lockerley Site Management Teams co-operated closely, often pooling labour and resources and finding common solutions to issues to aid progress. Many changes in the project team may have contributed to Design items above. Bulk of works crews were new to ISS. Possibly contributed to delays ie. learning curve. Where projects are geographically close to each other such co-operation such be promoted. If people are leaving not much can be done about it other than to ensure comprehensive and timely handover. Mix up crews so that experienced ISS personnel are present.a"
"Difficulty in getting NG to agree CEs until the end of project. EW/CE to be impacted on programme as we progress. NG did not table KPIs until project completion Escalate on future projects. On future projects. JMS, on future projects, to ensure that KPIs are received and agreed on a monthly basis thru’ out project cycle."
Fencing Materials: Ordering strainer post bracing bars after post installation. Concrete Batching Plant - Proximity to Site. This ensures accurate measurements can be taken bringing about a first time fit. Note: Close attention should be paid to lead times on these materials to ensure technical partner are not affected. Establish whether Client specification for the placement of concrete can be achieved (for instance 30mins between pours as outlined in CE1). IF this cannot be achieved a TQ should be submitted proposing alternative solutions. The 30 minute period was missed on one occasion resulting in quality issues.
"Deviations, through error, from construction drawings, for example; Base Surface Finish (DCN 014), Base Orientation (DCN 015). Integration (JMS & Tech Partner Siemens) – Pour Marshalling Box Plinths after Cabinet Placement. Construction of Concrete Rings around draw pit chambers. Ensure construction drawings are briefed out properly to operatives to ensure no deviations are brought about through misinterpretation. ii) Ensure thorough checks are carried out on all works. Ensures that the cabinet to be placed on the Base (sitting around the plinth) is not obstructed. Pouring after cabinet placement eliminates the risk of the box not fitting around this plinth. As a concrete ring surrounds each draw pit, soils settlement cannot occur ensuring a trip hazard does not arise. Also minimised vegetation / dirt falling into the draw pit upon opening and closing."
"Door Supplier, Ascot Doors, carried out their works to a very high standard. Planning, Installation and Punctuality (quotes, RAMS, delivery etc.) much better service than the suppliers previously used. Subcontractors from RMF called in to accelerate works at the UPS and Control Room. Ascot doors are slow in issuing certification for their works undertaken. First point of contact for future supply of Building Hardening materials. Ensure subcontractors are closely supervised. May be beneficial to have a JMS operative in the subcontracting gang to ensure quality is maintained. Ascot doors and other subcontractors need to be made aware of our requirements for certification prior to works undertaken."
"Once the contract had been awarded NG expected works to start instantly. This did not allow MPEP any time to produce the RAMS required. In hindsight the programme was optimistic, JMS failed to identify delays that could have produced EOTs. Confined and restricted site – additional allowance should have been made to programme. NG need to adapt a fast review process for RAMS when they expect works to start without suitable notice / programmed period for production and review of RAMS. Once slippage anticipated essential to strategise a solution to JMS favour. Future programmes to consider site restrictions."
Hired in resource as H&S advisor – generally worked well. A number of Best Practices were generated from site. Agency staff may be used again on ISS provided that ISS experience is met. Adopted on other sites.
"Throughout the project and through no fault of his own, the mobile plant fitter’s oil containers were being delivered and left for storage on the site. The stores did not have appropriate drip tray storage to contain such volumes of oil, and often these oil containers were being left without the knowledge of the site management resulting, on occasion, negative comments during Client inspections. At the start of the project a 205l waste oil barrel arrived on site generated from other non-ISS sites without the knowledge of the environmental advisor. This barrel proved to be quite difficult to remove as no-one wanted to take responsibility for the barrel. The barrel had a large potential to cause a pollution event and no provision had been made for an adequate drip tray for the barrel to be put on. Adopting a three tag system for spill kits seemed to eradicate pervious problems of items missing from kits. Each site should be made aware of the needs of the plant fitter and therefore could make appropriate allowances on site for such items that he may carry. Communication between Ollerton and site management about quantities of oil being sent to site. Provisions to be put in place for fitter to deal with his waste oil on each site as taking waste oil from one site to another without the correct paper work is illegal. At the start of the job all kits to be inspected and three tamper tags placed on them making it impossible for items to be taken from kits."
"Size of Site Compound: Due to limited space, a fixed lay down area for materials required during the project was not practical bringing about several issues (housekeeping, correct storage techniques, site congestion etc). Construction of Camera Towers before Installation. Ensure adequate space for a fixed lay down area is organised prior to site set up through negotiation with the Client and local landowners. Constructing the towers and then erecting them eliminates further lifting operations as well as working at height and their associated risks."
Use of interactive online training: Allows multiple operatives to be trained without the need for a trainer to attend site. Operatives trained in Asbestos Awareness & Fire Warden. Use interactive training again as it is low cost and accredited. Also very easy to organise and if training is required quickly this method is favourable.
Required to have potable water trucked in. If this situation occurs again look at alternative ways to reduce demand.
Weld length and weld spacing detail on strainer posts and gate posts not as per drawing detail but mostly found to be over specified as in weld length longer than specified. Communication with Lochrin Bain and Mott Macdonald who eventually communicated with each other and agreed that the actual weld detail was adequate. Lochrin Bain provided extra diligence during loading / packing and transportation of fence materials to ensure damage to fence materials was not repeated as at the Slapton project. Inspection/expediting visit to Lochrin & Bain highlighted some dimensional concerns on the double leaf gates. The gate lock keep / receiver was just fixed on with two screws. With regards to certification Lochrin Bain are very prompt and issue the certification package a few days after delivery of materials. LB are also very helpful and go the extra mile in addressing and closing out any issues. More stringent inspection regime to be implemented. Lochrin Bain to be informed weld detail is to be as per drawing for future projects. Extra communication with Lochrin Bain prior to loading of fence materials enforcing the need for extra vigilance/diligence during loading of fence materials. Dimension concerns were rectified immediately at the time of the visit. The lock keep/receiver was then welded at the LB factory as an extra security measure. Inspection visits to the supplier premises are a must. We need to look at gaining the certification from suppliers as soon as possible. Preferably prior to delivery of items as we seem to be chasing for certification long after installation has taken place.
"Telecoms and Internet Connections – NG EWN raised due to delay in providing these services. Ensure BT and internet providers are contacted at least once daily to establish dates for installation. Whilst site staff are waiting, a portable internet router could be bought to provide internet access. Consider the programme and any impact durations / lead times for IT equipment may have on the programme."
"On the whole, Client relations went well. It should be noted, however, that Barton Stacey was the first ISS site to commence construction and achieve asset acceptance within the same year."
"Though Civils design integrated with the Technical Partner at commencement on site, the Tech Partner subsequently required additional ducting to bases resulting in re-work to a number of bases. Design Change management generally complied with requirements. If possible the site team should check drawings prior to G17 so that any discrepancies with what is actually on site can be spotted (i.e. the concrete lip on the existing building clashing with the reinforcement). When excavating for concrete pads under the bridging beam, it was discovered that the trial hole records were inaccurate with regard to the position of the pipes. Written confirmation from the Technical Partner’s site team required prior to casting or installing ducts. (This was repeated from Chalgrove). To be repeated on future Projects. A more detailed survey by the designers, who did not visit site once during construction. All trial holes to have GPS coordinates recorded."
"The project team, apart from H&S advisor and Environmental Advisor, stayed the same throughout the project. The changing of H&S Advisor towards the end of the contract did not please the clients Rep on site. Although the PC handover meeting was held well before the actual date of handover. The Tech partner kept finding things to delay it. These items were not mentioned in the original meeting. Site team took responsibility of Data Books, with each member delegated a section to complete. Team worked well together and the continuity helped the contract run smoothly. Try and keep the same staff, if possible, throughout each project. JMS need to be more thorough at handover meetings to ensure nothing is missed. Most sections completed as the work proceeded. A few outstanding issues waiting for supplier details."
"Good input from site team (Foreman, Engineer etc.) identifying Early Warnings. Although the civils programme was short, because of lessons learned from previous projects, the triangle scores were constantly reviewed to make sure that we would reach our target by the end of the civils phase of the project. Works on site commenced before there was a finalised design and the design process was somewhat rushed to enable commencement of the works. This led to issues later in the project with design changes being implemented due to incorrect levels, inaccuracies on the drawings etc. Construction of yard and site facilities was extremely costly and exceeded recovery in the agreed price due to a number of factors:- 1. Slope of site establishment was very labour intensive in order to provide a level surface for offices & welfare facilities 2. This is also required a significant amount of hardcore material 3. There was a lot of resources brought in before there was a continuous flow of work to get on with. Repeated from previous Projects. Score for H&S and Environmental triangles both above 40 points, meaning no fee reduction. Avoid agreement on programme and mobilisation until there is an approved design that has been rigidly checked by all parties. Site establishment rates need to be reviewed on a site by site basis dependant on the topography of the area. Avoid taking on too many resources until RAMS, permits all in place and continuous work flow is guaranteed."
"Because of the Client changing the fence supplier after the contract had started, the fence was late in being delivered. Fence supplier (Betafence) kept promising delivery dates which they could not keep. NG should be challenged when they insist on nominating a supplier. When ordering critical materials, such as fencing, try and get firm lead times and delivery dates."
"Quality issues with gates and fence posts. One gate had to be sent back to change damaged post. Fence post had base plate welded on wrong end. Mesh panels around above ground pipework also needed re-work prior to install. Due to the time of year there was a concern that birds might nest in the camera towers while they were stored in the laydown area. Gates and posts to be thoroughly checked before and immediately after delivery, but because they were running late with deliveries we had no time to check properly. The camera towers were covered to prevent this happening."
"The quality of the brickwork to the ISS building was of a poor standard and sections of the walls had to be taken down. The designer, Capita Symonds, did not perform well on the project and the drawings were generally to a very poor standard throughout, causing various difficulties for the site team. Some subcontractors were very slow issuing O&M manuals, CofCs etc. for Data Books. More frequent quality checks on sub-contractors as the work proceeds. May be prudent to avoid using bricklaying subcontractor on future projects. May be prudent to avoid using this designer on future projects. In future, withhold final payment until all certification required has been received from subcontractor."
"Some of the key dates on the programme were for materials to be delivered before they were needed on site. This would have meant materials that could get damaged being delivered earlier than necessary, so they were delivered when needed throwing the key dates out. Key dates should reflect construction sequence."
"All aspects of NG / JMS health, safety and welfare requirements were met. . The importance of the triangle scores was realised because of lessons learned on previous projects, consequently the resultant KPI expectations were achieved. The programme for the project was of a short duration but the HS&E triangles beat the 40 score."
"Due to the position of the site, in a rural area not near any other communities, the BT connection would have been too expensive for the duration on site and taken too long to set up. Speedy hire were used to supply 3G Broadband and satellite phones were used in the offices. Although not ideal, this should be considered for future rural projects."
"Very Good . When taking the minutes at progress meetings, Clients Reps tend to write what they want to hear rather than accurate minutes. Check accuracy of minutes as soon as possible and challenge accuracy of Progress meeting minutes if they do not reflect what was said."
"As the project was on and off a few times, sufficient reviews of drawings did not take place leading to a lot of DCN for what should have been a simple project. Once commenced, progress was generally good and met with programme requirements. Time should be allocated post design / pre construction to carry out drawing reconciliation. Close coordination with client and tech partner identified key activities for smooth handover."
"Documented internal meetings which commenced at the start of the project did not continue throughout the project however communication between the site management team was good. Poor control of subcontractor/supplier for no 2 kiosk resulted in incorrect fabrication. The documented meeting is an essential internal tool to raise areas of concern for the project and if administered correctly would aid the management of the project as a whole. All site team engineers to fully under stand the implications of checking fab drawing to ensure correct fitting etc, irrespective whether this was the supplier responsibility."
"Design signed off with an unworkable solution to kiosk no2, resulting in site to resolve. Far too many DCNs generated during construction based on a less than detailed design. More diligence required in challenging designer proposals. Not sign off on generic details in design if not detailed enough to construct."
Temporary works design in place for all activities. System / process subject of NG audits - all good.
No short comings identified on site operations. Possibly too much resources on site due to reduced work on ISS framework not sufficient work flows.
"On project close down plant returns and site to site transfers could have been better. Mostly JMS plant utilised. Additional charges to project due to site to site transfers not being completed correctly, This is repetitive on many project close outs, ample admin resources should be available to complete the correct process for more effective/efficient close out."
"Fence supplier - Beta fence – made empty promises – again. Kiosk no2 supplier – Kingsley Plastics – incorrectly fabricated kiosk. Store man to check deliveries against PO. Beta fence were used on Iron acton, East Ilsley and Parrington ISS sites (and Shorne) previous experience from these sites was that Beta fence did not meet their delivery dates. Additional time placed in programme from previous LL, yet Beta still failed to deliver. Beta should not be used again unless their T&C are modified to recover costs that could be incurred due to late deliveries. More robust review of fabrication drawings to eliminate reworking. NG CAR seel Quality."
"All work generally completed by direct labour, no major sub cons used"
"All DCNs managed well. Required to use hired in QS. As per NG/JMS procedures, though too many. If a direct employee would have worked out cheaper and probably would have coverd other site too."
"CAR raised by client re POs; POs were held on site but not copied to storeman for checking against deliveries. Internal CAR raised on concrete records incomplete. Internal QOB raised on concrete path finish. Internal QOB raised on suppler of locks being not fully functional for access control – wrong locks. Process put in place to ensure all permanent material were checked against POs. Concrete activities had just commenced and mix register and call off form not in place – Ensure are records and correct procedure is followed from outset. Brush finish in wrong direction – parallel to path not at right angle to path,, path refinished correctly but situation should not have arisen in first place. drawings are briefed to ops prior to each activity to ensure all understand details etc. Difficult to prevent happening again as locks are very similar other than to confirm from supplier that they are the right ones etc."
"No major accidents or incidents. Consecutive positive scores and comments from the NG board visits carried out on site. Direct work force works well on NG framework project with good attitudes to work, H&S&W."
No incidents. All waste streams managed well.
"Management of existing programme to new programme. At the initial stages we discussed & negotiated with all the parties concerned Client, National Grid, Local authority and third parties to allow us to reach the optimal programme for the execution of the project works."
"Surveying. Construction method. Timely surveying allowed us to determine, that there were going to be extra works required. This allowed us to put these in place so as not to hold any part of the works up. Due to redesign our method of working was alerted allowing works to be completed to best suit site conditions."
Design Review. Design Change. We discussed & reviewed the design with the client and suggested improvements that would benefit both them and us. We redesigned their joint bays and some of the route which allowed us to change the working method required to carry out the works. These changes were agreed by both parties as preferential to the original design and helped mitigate against potential of damage to existing infrastructure.
Suitability of Temporary Works The temporary works needed to be redesigned due to unknown underground services and to suit site conditions. Temporary works were carried out in the prompt time scale and agreed by the client.
"Labour Competence, Training, Experience. The work force was selected on its experience competency especially for this project due to the complexity of the works area with existing services and equipment."
"Maintenance / certification JMS 40kVA Generator on the project kept tripping out and had two control panels replaced on it before it worked correctly .All other plant and equipment, mainly JMS, was received in good order and worked well. It was well maintained and in current certification."
Requisitioning was carried out correctly and in time for delivery to site or collection. This lead to an NCR being raised due to poor performance of the supplier. The site Supervisor and Project Manager ensured strict control on site. Spoil was reused on site as much as possible.
"Purchasing, Lead times. Competence & Experience. DCP – Security & Silverdale – Asbestos. As a reactionary business, a specialist Asbestos removal contractor had to be sourced with the right competence and experience to carry out the removal from site of this contaminated material. This was completed by Project personnel & the subcontracts department in a timely fashion, allowing us to carry on the works without delay."
"Understanding of contract / client requirements. Administration of contract Change control (including time bar). Communication (including document control, progress meetings). Our understanding of the contract and the client’s requirements allowed us to make suggestions that benefitted both ourselves and the client. Our in depth knowledge of the contract NEC3 and the client’s requirements for handling change of controls, allowed us to keep track of all changes. Meetings were held regularly at which all EWN and CE’s were discussed and either agreed at the meeting or soon afterwards."
Non-conformances. Records / Handover. Client’s Jointers. Only 1 no. NCR was raised on a supplier Lafarge. Their performance at handling our orders for the required materials was slow and sometimes none existent leading to lorries being turned away for collections. Our recording of all works and installation of ducts and cables were of a very high standard and met the client’s requirements easily. The client’s jointers work led to rework (joints failing) for JMS to allow them to replace joints.
These were set up quickly and were sufficient and well kept. 1 no Safety incident was reported for the duration of the works.
Waste management was handled as per group procedure for the duration of the contract.
These were all secured through our knowledge and quality of workmanship.
2No. projects both working in COLCT. Regular coordination meetings between UKPN and JMS project teams for both projects.
Design issued by client did not account for concurrent installation periods by 2No. contracts in COLCT. Pinch point identified in COLCT and installation method changed to prevent clash between the 2No. contracts in the Bankside to Step Plate Junction in COLCT.
"Breach of procedure by operatives leading to programme delays and high potential incidents Continual monitoring of performance of operatives including no notice emergency rescue tests, regular inspections by Authorised Person, regular briefings regarding confined space C working, all workings in COLCT being coordinated under one project, separate PICoS supervisors for each projects, and clear management plan for the tunnels. Ensure the correct equipment is in place at all times whilst working within the COLCT."
Task Specific RAMs for both projects required further detail on the interface required for working within the COLCT. FS & LL RAMs to be updated to reflect the co[1]ordination & interface required for works within the COLCT. Confined Space Management Plan for Working within COLCT has also been developed for implementation for the projects. (Document will be reviewed and updated as works progress to reflect any changes required).
"Inadequate management of resources and time prior to the start of the project led to drawings not being fully reviewed by the site team. This led to some changes during construction. As the project was on and off a few times, sufficient reviews of drawings did not take place leading to a lot of DCN for what should have been a simple project. Design coordinator not resourced as ISS project is reducing resulting in the site manager covering this role. DCN’s not issued in a timely fashion. Several examples including the FCC & PCC bases ducting not fitting for purpose. Drawings must be reviewed prior to construction and again once construction has commenced. Time should be allocated post design / pre construction to carry out drawing reconciliation. Ensure the appointment of a fully qualified design change coordinator who fully understands the client’s requirements for the design change process. The site should be fully set out as soon as practicable to check the design against actual site levels and co-ordinance to ensure that everything will fit as designed. This should include, trial holes and marking of services, positions of built plant and anywhere there are design clashes."
Designers contract had been had been closed out before construction start meaning there was no designer to review DCNs at the start of the project. Temporary works briefings carried out thoroughly for drawings etc however there was no record of attendance kept until identified by an audit. No formal tender/document handover. Documented internal meetings which commenced at the start of the project did not continue throughout the project however communication between the site management team was good. Design contract to be maintained until project completion. Ensure evidence of all briefing attendance is available and saved on the F-drive. This should be done in future as a priority to highlight and pass on relevant information. The documented meeting is an essential internal tool to raise areas of concern for the project and if administered correctly would aid the management of the project as a whole.
"Levels of man power were always at critical level due to lack of resources. Site set up was completed to program with the minimum of resources. Too many interruptions due to training for site personnel. The training was planned but as the programme slipped, the site managers training clashed with the close out of project. Site operatives all previous ISS so fitted well. No messing with BT, used Speedy dongles which everyone was happy with. The need for additional personnel (joiners) was planned for however it proved difficult to resource them from agencies due to current market demand. During site establishment, we required a large volume of Stone. Site checked availability of re[1]cycled Stone but there was none available in the area. Due to the large volume of Stone required for the site establishment within a tight programme, site were not confident that one supplier would be able to handle the volume in a timely manner. During site establishment, temporary Cabins are required creating the need to bring in a large mobile Crane to off-load JMS Cabins that would have to be moved again two weeks later once the Lay Down area had been stoned. Initially water had to come from a tap inside the AGI or to be supplied on a weekly basis by a Bowser. Resource trades for the project early doors to give time to source. The project management team should ensure they have adequate resources prior to agreeing a start date. Preplanning and getting the right people for the job. Using Speedy IT solution aided this greatly. Training for key personnel should be planned in advance to ensure limited disruption to the project. MPEP should have adequate resources in place to be able to cover planned absence from site. MPEP are too easy to lend their site staff to other projects but are always too shy to ask for return favours. MPEP should ensure that as a BU they hold a couple of reserves to cover sickness, holidays and training. Having previous experience of ISS is a plus where possible. It is a credit to JMS to have such a high quality of personnel, they are multi[1]disciplined and would turn their hand to anything. Avoid landline connections in future. Identify the need for agency staff asap and contact them with requirements to avoid issues. The most feasible and carbon footprint friendly solution was to import quarried material from a nearby quarry. The site team decided to set up orders with two separate Stone suppliers in order to keep a constant supply of Stone running to the site. Hire in Towable Welfare Units that are high quality, towable and easily removeable for initial site establishment works. The site team identified a water main outside the site entrance and tapped into this for the compound supply saving on expensive Bowsers."
Client relationships good throughout the project. Open dialogue and early notification of issues to the site representative and the project engineer have.
Sub-contractor procurement for building hardening has caused delays to the project. Ascot doors delays are down to them. Steelway delay partly due to drawings not being approved in a timely fashion by the site manager. Pickersgill-Kaye locks lead in time of 16 weeks while not delaying completion of the whole of the works delayed gate manufacture by 4 weeks. The long lead in time was only brought to our attention in May despite the items being ordered in early April. Mitigation for item 2 above was to purchase a dummy lock to allow gate manufacture and not delay the construction process on site. No major issues. Supplier Ascot slow to respond with drawings which has affected the programme. More supplier options are required but we are bound by client preferred supplier lists. Orders where possible to be time bound. As item 1 above. Order should have been placed with Ascot sooner. Monitor subcontractors and document progress with a tracker or in the meeting minutes.
3-4 week delay on project however this cannot be pinned to NG. Works commenced on site 6 weeks prior to receiving the signed contract with agreed price and programme. Site QS left site during construction phase and not replaced. Works should not start on site prior to receiving the agreed contract or without pre-start handover. Adequate resources from commercial during construction are critical to the company.
3-4 weeks behind due to a combination of JMS related issues. Design/RAMS/resources With better planning and foresight this issue could have been mitigated.
Plant procurement has been very good throughout the project. Some items ordered late. 1 item of plant not requested by nor delivered to site was being charged to site at £100 per week and took 14 weeks to get off the plant list. GPS Equipment was supplied from Ollerton but it did not work. Engineer spent half a day troubleshooting only to discover that the Company licence for the kit had expired. Early notification of requirements to the plant dept. Pre start handover (tender handover) could have prevented this. Fragmentation in the plant departments for the group made tracing this items origin difficult and time consuming. More centralised management may help. Once the license fee was paid the kit worked perfecty. Recommendation that one person within the business unit is responsible for maintaining a Register of GPS Equipment and Licence expiry dates to avoid re[1]occurrence in the future.
"Fencing materials delivered to site were of good quality. WEC poles delivered with obvious repairs. These were not evident when inspected at the factory so alternate poles assumed shipped. Bolts from Lochrain-Baine were too long for the closure plates. A NCR was received from NG for Data Book compilation being behind target. This was incorrect as the Guidelines / targets issued by NG were unachievable and at odds with what was required by the Data Book Reviewers who sign the books off. Quality documentation and Audits were carried out on this project in a timely fashion. Lochrain-Baine have been very proactive with extra materials orders and quick turnaround of deliveries. Suppliers to ensure items offered for inspection at factories are the items shipped to site. Lochrain-Baine replaced FOC next day after notification. This was successfully challenged and, although NG wouldn’t withdraw the NCR, they have now amended the Guidelines in line with our comments and have offered a Briefing Workshop for all MWC Document Control Managers to ensure that we are all understanding the new Guidelines. It is Quality Department’s intention to be more actively involved at the pre-construction / start phase of the project. This is likely to be a briefing for project staff during the site hand over meeting and also on-site support for the team as the site is set up to ensure that the key processes are put in place thoroughly prior to the Pre Construction Audit in the early weeks of the project."
"Q3 issued to the site for RAMS. The original RAMS submitted referenced electrical sites when Treaddow is a gas site. For some reason this was missed 3 times (Writer, Reviewer, Approver) and submitted to the client. It is recognised that there was adequate time to prepare the RAMS within the programme, but inefficient use of time meant that the RAMS we compiled at the last minute and the Writer, Reviewer and Approver did not take enough time to correctly compile and check these documents. Project was on and off on a few occasions which resulted in JMS taking eye off the ball for RAMS and plans submittal, added with NG PE being a bit pedantic regarding adequacy of initial RAMS. This caused a 3 week delay to the project. Site Safety Management impeccable. The welfare set up on site was very good and received many positive comments throughout the duration of the project from visitors, NG board members etc. Consecutive positive scores and comments from the NG board visits carried out on site. Ensure that the people responsible for producing RAMS are given adequate time, resources and information in order to produce quality RAMS. No NG project to start on site until at least 6 weeks’ worth of works has RAMS in place. Use this as the benchmark for other sites. Continue to maintain these high standards on future projects. Continue to maintain these high standards on future projects."
"Short duration of project put getting 40 points on the triangles in jeopardy. The site team got the points by focussing TBTs, SHE contacts and ESDs on environmental issues. The project does not have a requirement for a full time environmental advisor however TBTs, contacts, ESD’s, BP adoptions, checks and mitigation still had to be carried out in order to hit the target of 40 points. These duties were carried out mainly by the H&S Advisor & Project Foreman which takes them away from their own duties. Fuel Consumption was monitored by the Site Storeman by means of an Excel Spreadsheet which proved to be a valuable exercise for tracking usage to a specific item of plant. Diesel Generator on-site was using approximately 2500 litres a month amounting to a substantial project cost. Convince client that on shorter duration projects that point’s scores need to reflect duration. This approach did work well but it would be better if the environmental requirements for these projects could be discussed with the client to ensure that an environmental advisor is allocated to the project for a sufficient amount of time to ensure all the required duties are carried out. 1 day per week is not enough considering they must achieve the same target of 40 points. Develop a standard spreadsheet which can be rolled out on other sites. Alternatives such as switching to smaller secondary Generators or Battery Packs should be considered on future projects with small site accommodation set ups."
"Project was relatively simple however due to a combination of a number of JMS own goals, a delay has occurred. Some repetitive items from previous lessons learned. Master Document Register – There were several individual RAMS and Plans Registers at the start of the project. MPEP quality department are currently working on a document to address this issue and provide sites with information of previous lessons learned. When Alison came onto the job, she created a Master Document Register which was a very useful tool used to track the progress of the pre-start documentation. On future projects, the site team need to use this document and review it daily to ensure that the key dates for document submissions are not missed. In Treaddow we allocated RAMS to the different members of the project team, but because we were not all sitting at one desk looking at MDR we missed a couple of submission dates."
"Project staff under extreme pressure to deliver documentation within the time scales ED + 3 weeks. WPS delays due to numerous errors. Reliance on one person or a single source of supply. Good reporting in programme format on a weekly / monthly basis giving full historic and forecasted information to the Client. Ensure adequate time and resources to develop and submit good quality documentation. Adhere to Programme and deadlines to prevent delays on site. With reference to the section above ‘Welding procedures tight parameters’, with only one welder qualified the project was at risk if the welder became ill or was not available for any reason. This could also risk the project being “held to ransom” by the welder. Projects should always ask the “what if” question in relation to the project team, there should always be a Plan B. This situation also pertains to the availability of specialist equipment. Good practices within the team to enable accurate planning and forecasting dates."
"Good engineering control from the commencement of the project, enabling the engineers to keep on top of the work loads and reporting. Best available techniques adopted. Haul road to floating road used on site thus reducing the amount of peat disturbed. Welding procedures with tight parameters. Allocation of engineering staff is crucial to the success of the project. Early reviews of drawings highlighted and ironed out any potential delays. In similar conditions, JMS should consider this approach. It is crucial that, through early contractor involvement, any ideas of a change on the proposed work process or technique is pursued with the Client at the earliest opportunity so there are no surprises. JMS should have qualified the procedures with at least two welders - this would have given a wider parameter range. A consequence of qualifying with only one welder was WPQT x 4 dipped the tests."
Early design checks carried out which highlighted issues with the design to allow changes in good time and not to delay progress. Good review of design by engineering staff. Experienced pipeline engineering essential for review of design drawings.
"The Client encouraged best available techniques resulting in cost-saving. However, the Client has requested 100% of the cost[1]savings. Expensive bulk backfill. Ensure only the required fill surround is used, saving on materials and transport. Scaffolding steps procured for access into trench - steps not utilised due to scaffolding steps requiring Scaffolders to erect and dismantle. Good review of design by engineering staff. Experienced pipeline engineering essential for review of design drawings. Project to check and agree the Best Available Techniques and Value Engineering savings split before proceeding with any changes. Specific backfill box manufactured on site with lifting eyes enabling the operatives to use only the specified amount of soft fill around the pipe. Proprietary system or Class 1 ladder to be utilised on site."
"Operatives not trained and therefore didn’t have the correct competencies to carry out the works. Labour mobilised to site without defined pay structure. Undefined shift rota resulting in last minute flights costing a premium. Labour costs. Flight costs and control. Travelling expenses for operatives approx. £1000 / month. Unaccounted costs for operatives travelling from home to airport. Training requirement to be identified prior to mobilising operatives. Agreed rates of pay to be determined prior to mobilising labour. Project calendar to be developed early to enable planning of flights to ensure maximum discount were available. Not in line with tender allowances, labour rates to be aligned with tender. Tender allowances for flights require increasing. Align travelling expenses / time and working rota with the industry standard. Consider setting price per mile to cover travelling expenses to and from airports, based on postcodes."
"OMS mobilised to site with incorrect umbilical cord camera to laptop. Plant and equipment arriving on site with short calibration life span. Electrical equipment shipped with no PAT or little time left on PAT. London Plant Hire Department insisted the Project was to source its own fuel bowsers and purchase fuels directly, rather than pay a small percentage over costs. The cost of shipping and plant rental outweighed the additional costs. Welding - Tungsten inclusion becoming an issue. Faulty JMS plant mobilised to project. Welfare and Canteen facilities set up on site. Assets purchased by project. Ensure a full understanding from the sub[1]contractor of what is required, I believe OMS wasn’t aware of the term ‘double ender’ in relation to the lengths of pipe to be welded. Ensure plant and equipment has at least the duration of the project unless the project is more than 12 months. Ensure PAT testing is completed prior to equipment being shipped. Project complied with London which resulted in additional costs to the Project. Sourced a different tungsten from Rossweld in Aberdeen which resulted in almost totally eradicating tungsten inclusion from the welds. Prior to sourcing these electrodes, we were experiencing a high volume of weld with inclusion and subsequently cutting out the welds rather than repair due to being unable to detect the inclusion with UT. There was no particular saving from the initial value of the contract but we reduced the repair ratio and eradicated the inclusion issues we were experiencing by 99%. New or fully checked and serviced plant with spares to be mobilised to enable repairs to be carried out on site if required. Alternatively, on larger or less inaccessible Projects, consider employing a JMS Fitter on site. Enabling operatives to maintain allocated break durations increased production on site. The Project purchased plant and equipment directly but were also charged hire rates from the Regional Office."
"MTO developed with conditional formatting to identify long lead items. Protection slabs procured and cast by local firm, Morris and Hunter. Good overall control of materials both ordering and the response from the Buying Department. OMS camera survey - unsuitable equipment was mobilised. Following investigation, both parties believed the terminology used on the project was unfamiliar to the contractor. Improved functional MTO developed and in use on the project which enabled potential delays to be mitigated. Cost-saving on both purchase price of the slabs and also shipping costs. Purchase order to be returned to site to enable control of all materials procured for the project. Pre–mobilisation meeting to be held with site based staff to ensure contractor is fully aware of methodology to be used on site."
"Subcontractor, OMS, mobilised without the necessary competencies (CSCS). SPREE subcontract - un-checked and unsuitable equipment mobilised to site, The subcontractor was required to replace most of the equipment due to it being sub-standard. Rotation of Subcontract staff. Prior to mobilising subcontractors ensure sub[1]contractors’ competencies are up-to-date and the correct competencies have been checked. The subcontract enquiry should include and set out the provision, by the subcontractor, of all expected documentation required for the Project (Murphy, Client, Legislation, Regulations, Standards), ie. Plans, ITPs, Report Forms, minimum Competence requirements. Consider withholding the formal order until the required HSQE documentation, proof of training and competence, has been submitted by the subcontractor. It is often very difficult to obtain the appropriate, and necessary, paperwork from a subcontractor when we have issued the order. More detail to be provided by JMS on the exact site requirement for both personnel and equipment during the subcontractor procurement process. Pre- mobilisation meeting to be held with contractor to reinforce JMS requirements. Ensure full staff handover is completed prior to rotation, delays experienced due to lack of knowledge of site activities."
"JMS encouraged to use BAT techniques which has the potential to reduce the contract sum. Inclusion of additional scope of works. Good monthly commercial reporting including breakdown of all work packages. Contract Rates / Change Order Rates misinterpreted. Delays to Subcontract Invoice Payment. Flights and payments need to be controlled on site to alleviate mistakes and save money, or set up accounts with airline companies. Clarification required from the Client if there are to be any commercial penalties prior to using BAT techniques. If the Client Project credit card / charge card to be issued.requires the commercial savings then agree the VE split. In-depth analysis required for inclusion of additional works which could impede production / programme. Additional works need to be agreed prior to works commencing. Beneficial to both JMS and the Client. Good, clear, concise reports should be issued both internally and externally. The Preliminary Rate was misinterpreted at tender stage which lead to a dispute with the Client. A clear understanding of the Rates should be established with any ambiguity qualified or clarification sought. On numerous occasions there were delays to the payment of invoices after being processed on site. This led to numerous complaints from suppliers and lost productivity of the site teams. A better process for ensuring invoice payment is needed.Project credit card / charge card to be issued Project credit card / charge card to be issued "
"The research and development carried out in Ollerton on the Weld Procedures increased expenditure. Induction Coil over engineered - a smaller version is available from Canusa which can be lifted manually thereby freeing up excavator and operator - cost saving. Project documentation required altering at site level. Submission of documents. Good overall control of documentation, all issued documents stamped with recipient’s name this made revised document much easier to re-issue. At the request of the Client, documents were sent as flash copies without control of revisions. This ended in confusion when issuing documents to the Client’s Document Control. Weld Engineer to be employed as consultation specialising in 22% Duplex Pipe. Detailed plan to ensure R&D tax savings are maximised. Purchasing Enquiries should be issued with the full specification of what’s required to be sourced. Site specific forms used on site giving the project availability to alter forms to suit the client’s requirements. Good document control required agreed with the project manager. Ensure all forms are water marked as “example” this enables the forms to be revised without revising the full document. Allocated responsibility to one member of staff to ensure all project drawings were up-to-date. Reinforce Murphy’s Document Control procedure to Clients and all staff developing project documents. Documents must be formally issued and controlled by Murphy’s Document Controllers."
"Lifting and placing Induction Coil leading to an injury due to untrained operative. PPE on site may not meet the minimum standards if it has been brought onto site by an individual rather than supplied my JMS. Specific PPE - Wet-Weather Gear. Wrapping crew requires slingers signaller training to enable the crew to be self-sufficient. PPE inspection to be added to the site induction in order to prevent any unfit items of PPE being used on site. Good quality wet weather gear, ie. Gortex suits and sub-zero temperature wellingtons are an absolute must considering the extreme weather encountered on the Shetlands. See Nick Milner for details."
"Mudtech system working well, discharged water is high quality and free from debris. Good system and cost saving compared to Silt Buster system costs."
Incorrect plant and equipment shipped to Shetlands. Good control of certificates for all hoses blinds and equipment. Full itinerary of plant and equipment to be issued to the Test Engineer prior to mobilizing. Full test pack populated prior to mobilisation and issued to Client.
"The original horizontal and vertical alignment from Amec did not take account of the bends available on site and also resulted in the IP points provided being incorrect. The pipeline for approx one third of the project was located in rock of depths up to 2m even though there would have been sufficient cover to the pipeline if laid along the top profile of the bedrock. Excessive excavation works required for the installation of an 8” pipe with approx 50000m3 of peat needing to be moved. In certain locations peat was called up as backfill material around the pipe making working conditions difficult once rain fell on the peat. Temporary works design along the security road was insufficient. JMS re-plotted both alignments taking account of the materials available, generated correct IP points and provided same to Amec for incorporation into final design. More time should be allowed to interrogate the design. Peat probing may have been inaccurate. Alternative installation methods should be explored. Designers should consider alternative backfill materials when doing their stress analysis. TWC to provide correct information to temporary works designers."
"Project team worked well together, no issues noted, the Client appeared to be satisfied. Good communication between the project teams based both at Total and BP especially considering the remote locations. Lack of onsite office secretary, large amounts of time was taken up by tasks such as organising flights/ferries and everyday office duties etc. Employing a local temporary secretary may have been beneficial."
"Due to the original programme being squeezed it was not possible to shut site activities down for leave cycles, thus resulting in a work force of 25% above planned to cover operatives on rotation. The requirement for dedicated fire watchers was not accounted for, BP’s requirement is that the Top Man and the Fire Warden cannot be covered by one person, this resulted in 3 extra non-working positions, one for each habitat (Confined Space). Labour rates did not include cost of travel to and from airports which was claimed by most of the workforce - Trains, taxis, fuel, hire cars, and airport car parks. Mobilisation /demobilisation prices were higher than in the pricing schedule. No allowance was made for laundering of boiler suits. Payments to local services were not always cleared in a timely manner, thus resulting in blocked accounts for important services, i.e. welding gas and supply of electrician to carry out PAT testing. BP were a great proactive client and we should be trying to work with that project team again as soon as possible. BP provided fuel and we also had fuel priced into our plant rates so savings were made. Flights need to be booked well in advance to save money; this was not always possible due to periodical lack of funds on the head office credit card leading to site staff having to spend unacceptable amounts of their own money. In similar projects moving forward, the full construction team should be on a simultaneous leave cycle. This would also allow the onsite staff to have a full uninterrupted leave cycle. The Clients’ special requirements need to be accounted for at Tender Stage. Travel expenditure to be considered during pricing. To be considered during pricing. Should be considered during pricing. Project to be given more control for payment of local suppliers. Other departments within the JMS organisation should arrange for their invoices to be GRN’d and paid promptly. JMS to maintain contact with BP management. Project to have funds to control flights and other expenses."
"Most plant was available on the Island at competitive rates, some plant i.e. pumps and long-reach excavators were only available from the mainland, however good planning and early mobilisation meant there was no adverse impact to schedule. Bog mats used on the projects where ground conditions are predominantly peat bog, need to be managed carefully, machine operators need to understand that the mats are not consumables, and the cost to the project can be significant. Items procured by the project but also charged at hire rates internally. All plant and equipment going into the SVT must undergo security and garage checks, this can take up to 3 working days. Plant and equipment arriving on site with short calibration life span. Electrical equipment arriving to site with no PAT or a short PAT. To be repeated on future remote Projects. Tool box talk to all concerned. This had a negative impact on the project and should not be happening. This should always be accounted for - good planning to be in place to ensure no delays when introducing new plant to the SVT. Ensure plant and equipment are newly calibrated. As above, all electrical equipment to arrive on site with PAT to cover the project duration were possible."
"Most materials were free issue. It was found however that materials procured on the Island proved to be far more expensive than mainland prices. Some items i.e. standard engineering pegs were not available on the Island and have to be made to order, this resulting in inflated prices. Better planning during mobilisation of projects in remote locations. Improved communications from site to allow timely procurement of required materials which will help to alleviate the need to buy local goods at inflated prices. During mobilisation these should be brought in from the mainland as required."
"OMS had some minor breakdowns which could have proved disastrous for the programme. Fortunately solutions were found. Generally both main subcontractors (Spree & OMS) performed well, and provided good quality reports. Plant suppliers on the island were generally very accommodating and provided fitters to the project regardless of who owned the plant. Backup equipment should always be available with specialist sub[1]contractors, particularly for remote projects. Both subcontractors can be considered for future work on similar projects."
Works generally carried out well within programme. Extra hour paid to performing authorities resulted in permits being available early and dramatically reduced the NPTs from a projected 46.7% to aprox 33.0% Good quality weekly/ monthly reports produced for Client’s meetings. Continue to plan and resource with a view to maintaining schedules and programmes. Long queues would form and only being at the head of them would get the crews off to a timely start. This was well appreciated by the Client and helped to maintain accurate planning and date forecasting.
"All aspects of BP / JMS Health, Safety and Environmental requirements were met. Arrangement of inductions sometimes delayed the start of personnel on site mainly due to paperwork being lost within SVT. Weekly KPIs were required by BP. It was a requirement of JMS to have employees ISSOW trained in order to become Performing Authorities within Sullom Voe Terminal. This proved difficult at first as training was only provided in Aberdeen. Upon request JMS were able to do P.A training in S.V.T The weekly KPIs proved to be very beneficial for the vast reports provided by the JMS project team on a weekly basis. The JMS Performing Authorities were required to take out all work permits from the S.V.T Area Authorities with whom they created a very positive working relationship with."
"Transition from 02 to Vodafone. Mobile phones changed to Vodafone even after being requested to maintain 02 Network for the duration of the project due to poor Vodafone coverage on the Island. This led to loss of communications for several days until the 02 connections were restored. Requirement for project team to travel to London for Windows 8.1 & Office 13 training and deployment. Responsible department should heed the advice of project team, particularly when the project is so remote. This would probably have been less disruptive and cheaper for the training to come to Shetland. Remote locations should be considered when organising training."
"Excellent. The relationship with the Client’s project team was a very positive aspect and certainly contributed to the project coming in ahead of programme, this could have been a real problem especially regarding the constraints we could have faced without their full support whilst dealing with the SVT asset teams .Highlights the importance of good Client-Contractor relations and adhering to programme. Contact should be maintained between JMS senior management and BP management to ensure JMS is kept in mind for future works."
"Only one welder to carry out procedures resulted in very tight parameters, this also meant incoming welders failing to qualify. A few field welds were rejected also due to this. Inspection and quality control generally of a high standard, good standard reporting. More than one welder to be used during qualification of procedures, or “extremes of parameters” procedure to be qualified."
"Initial programme needs to have realistic production rates and durations. Use of Subcontractor, couldn’t keep up with agreed programme. Winter working in Scotland. Monthly programme update. Tree felling works outside Bird Nesting season March to August. No access granted to certain sites by Client by contract date. During winter months production rates dropped due to shorter workings, availability of light and harsh weather. If possible programme any works in Scotland after the winter months. Manage more in house or more than one subcontractor. Develop better in-house, fencing capabilities. More time to be allowed in programme for weather events. CE for weather- NG. Well received by NG. Phase two all vegetation felled prior to nesting season. Reshuffle Programme / keep in contact with client to mitigate against delays."
"Welfare unit – Site office. Security. Surveying & Setting out. H&S Inspections. Snagging, only completed at the end of the ten sites. Poor IT facilities on site. Worked well for site accommodation, logistic issues with cleaning of the units. Apollo Security worked well, during out of construction hours. Controlled by position of the Gas pipeline, centre the bays over the mains. JMS internal H&S inspections throughout the project. Each site should be snagged prior to demob. Provide site printers for scanning & printing facilities."
Gate Design-Design didn’t account kerb and road levels. Fence changes from Panel to Roll. Design Change. PMI – Sleeping policeman. Propose to Client in future as it allowed for quicker production and improved site programme to help offset any other delays. Propose to Client in future as it allowed for quicker production and improved site programme to help offset any other delays.
"All designs were CAT 0 or CAT 1. Track Mats utilised for service crossing over the mains as opposed to bog matts. JMS procedure worked well, robust to NG audits. Proved easier to transport between the sites with the transient nature of the works."
"Lack of Environmental Advisor. Visiting H&S Advisor. Lack of Project management. JMS crews not suited to fencing works. Sub-Contract personal had no SCO on NG database. Resulted in prolonged Data Book close out. Worked well on the project, visited 2 days a month, and should possibly be increased for phase 2 works. Due to staff shortages, Site Manager took on the role- Select crew with adaptable to fencing works- civils works etc. Train crew or employ experienced fencing personal. Demand proof to ensure all sub-con have personal on SCO data base. Make sure JMS SCO’s are up to date."
"Hire / Off-hire, process very difficult due the transient nature of the works- lack of IT, logistics. Mostly external hired plant utilised due to transient nature of the sites. Wi-Fi dongles and I Pad or similar should be issued to SM or crew member on similar future projects. Worked well, some logistic issues with collection dates from sites."
"Materials mainly supplied by subcontractor. Remote testing of the concrete for CE1 specification worked well. Lead time on fence materials under 3 weeks. Worked well throughout the project, worked on a call off per site basis. Worked well. Had a positive effect on progress throughout the project."
"Procter’s Fencing the main sub-contractor on the project. Security. Struggled to manage the agreed programme, lack of commercial knowledge to NEC3, proved difficult to provide substantiation required for NG. Refer to previous project feedback form. Not recommended to work on JMS site again. Appollo security worked well, no issues. Recommended to work on other JMS sites."
"NEC3 & Framework Contract Clauses (Ground & Weather). Good use of EWN. Agreement of CE’s. Final Account. Document control. Good understanding of the clients requirements JMS were responsible for ground and weather conditions. This caused delay and disruption to the programme. Ensure these clauses are fully accounted for when pricing the project. Factor these possible costs in. Mitigated delays, lead to increased contract value through PMI and CE. Compensation Events were well detailed & had full back up from various sources ensuring an easy agreement with the Client. Settled in full prior to final site close out. Worked well good working relationship between SM & DC. Excellent site relationship with the client. Positive result– Phase two single sourced."
"Data Books. QBS. ITP’S. JMS Audits. Lack of resources on Environmental, PM resulted in data book overhanging. Positive 8 or 9 raised on site throughout the project. Good use of ITP’s to resolve defects and quality issues. 7 Internal audits throughout the project were success full. Throughout the project were positive including a visit from SSR. Most Client Audits 95-100%."
"Site Set-up. Towable Welfare unit. COSSH Boxes. H&S General. NG impressed with JMS demarcation, signage and information available at each site. Continually scored high on site establishment audits. Good sized units, enough space for each the crew, positive worked well as each site duration lasted no longer than 5 weeks. Lockable COSSH Boxes utilised they worked well on the sites, these boxes were easy to transport to the next scheduled site. No reportable Incidents of the duration of the project, KPI’s always submitted on time. Daily take 5’s on each operational site and weekly TBT delivered. High standard of H&S on all sites, commented on by client and reflected on both internal and external audits."
"Environmental Management. Lack of Environmental Advisor. No reportable incidents, worked to the various environmental plans on the MDR. Underestimated how important the role of the advisor was."
"Good Relationship with Client .This was established from the offset with the Murphy WE CAN DO approach. This allowed the project to run very smoothly in the main, hence phase two works single sourced and other smaller works through PMI’s."
"Was there sufficient detail given/considered within Tender? Were Project Members involved with the tender / familiar with scheme? Any omissions that have come to light since contract award? AOB. In general it was agreed that the tender captured the bulk of points through various tender clarifications being undertaken during the tender process. We raised a number of points as did the other tenderers. Fortunately there were a couple of the Project Team involved at Tender stage with the assistance of writing case studies and plans for the tender. This does gives those individuals a good insight into the scheme and an opportunity to put forward their views and input as well as a head start for when the scheme is eventually awarded. All too often the people who are to be undertaking the scheme are never involved with the tender or consulted, we feel that this needs to be looked into going forwards. We realise it is not always possible but should be explored. We realised that working in London we did not allow for the congestion charge for all of our vehicles and the use of more local labour may have cut down on the lodge and accommodation expenses. We feel that JMS or PEP need a stronger and larger dedicated tender team. Often people are being called to provide input for tender’s last minute as well as balancing their day job and workload. The recently introduced Bid / No-Bid process is useful and would appear to ensure risks are reviewed and buy in is sought from Executive level before proceeding. The tender handover meeting could have had a little more time dedicated to it and planned better. Often when the site team had a query about the tender, our Estimating Team were too busy and stretched on other schemes to be able to assist or respond in a timely manner."
"Adequate staff to be allocated to the project? Experienced project members to be used? Used to this type of work and process and Client familiarity? AOB. From the outset the list of names provided for tender was a strong Team. Unfortunately Canada took a couple of resources and other resources that should have been released from other schemes (Beckton) were not released. The arrival of some staff was a little late in the day. The people we have on the scheme now are working hard and producing good results but it has involved long hours and determination to get to where we are which is testament to those we still have on site. Yes there were, although individuals were put forward for the scheme (Micheal Galvin) and attended Client interviews never worked on the scheme. Brian O’Connell was only around for a short period of time also. Of the original 4 that attended the Client interviews, only 2 remain on site now (Colin and Alan Dixon). The staff involved with this scheme have experience of undertaking this type of work previously (Cross Rail C233 & C305). More engineers and Environmental support would have been useful from the outset. Of the £16.884M target cost, there was £8.1M in Provisional Sum sites. We used the people on the scheme to undertake the upfront works for these, rather than bringing in additional resources, who we may have struggled to find and then would have to release from the scheme a few months later."
"Permanent Design not responsibility of JMS. Was design sufficiently far progressed? How was design change process managed? Integration with Client’s Design Team – earlier integration? More regular meetings? Spend time in same office? Experienced and knowledgeable engineers to be put in charge of specific packages.AOB. There have been some considerable delays waiting for Issued For Construction (IFC) Drawings from both UKPN and from TTT. This has held up the procurement and development of some of the consents until the known scope was confirmed. The Document Control system adopted by TTT meant there were drawings being issued with long digit file names and ease of referencing was very difficult. This was passed back to TTT where a slight improvement was made but still far from ideal. Due to a number of late changes made by the client, we feel as a Project Team we have reacted quickly and positively to these. It has been difficult to gauge the level of information required within the Environment Agency consent applications, due to not being allowed to liaise directly with the EA at the request of the Client. Integration with the Clients designer could have had an earlier relationship forged but this was not for a want of trying. Recently we were fully engaged with the solution development for Nine Elms and have been complimented on our approach and proposed solution to this challenging piece of work. Good working relationships have been maintained with the Clients designers (Atkins & Hyder). Regular meetings being maintained now, but could have started these meetings earlier in the process. Important meetings were held with the Client and the EA where items were agreed without the involvement of JMS. We feel that the process could have been more streamlined by JMS being involved from the outset and leading the discussions with the EA, with the client in attendance. Engineer’s capabilities are adequate for the works, it was felt that bringing on the engineers or earlier involvement in some of the design and works would have benefitted the scheme. An allowance for a full time Land Surveyor could/should be considered for a scheme of similar nature in the future. Whilst there was an allowance for a full time CAD resource, we feel that internally this was not managed particularly well and that the individual assigned for this should be site based rather than working remotely. Works specifications are not particularly clear and easy to locate. It has been suggested that going forwards on this scheme that a start-up meeting will be held for each of the new sites a minimum of 4 weeks in advance to ensure all key people are involved to give an opportunity to raise any concerns and discuss the works are ensure all works and consent requirements re understood. It may also be beneficial in some instances to invite the Client along to these meetings."
"CAS? MAXcel / Reporting of / Understanding contract requirements/what we signed up for. Site permissions / support from KT / Site understanding process and requirements / Timesheets / overtime? Understand procurement process and Compete4? Procurement Manager and expeditor. Subcontract / Professional Services / material orders. Has feedback been undertaken for services to date? Procurement/raising of cheques and BACS payments? Free issue materials / Long lead items. Cost Allocation System – this was promised in a 14 page document submitted with our tender and was highlighted as being the best software available to ensure we complied with the contractual obligations as set out in the tender. The implementation of CAS was not supported by KT Executive members and has resulted in us being late with costs and not providing our Client with the information we promised them. This had led to 2 strong letters from our Client to date about our poor cost control and reporting. From the outset of the scheme there was no clear handover or direction given from the Commercial Department on what our duties were for the levels and information of reporting required to the client. It would be of great benefit to the Project Team for a 1 day course on NEC3 Option C to be given to make them aware of what is included, what is not, where the risks and opportunities lie, process for additional works or change in works, delays etc. Our commercial representative (Iain Rae) at the start of the contract was not a direct JMS employee, nor did he have a good understanding of the contract or administer it particularly well nor fill the Client or Project Team with confidence. We lost Liz Coggins quite early on in the scheme and getting a replacement was not as quick as we would have liked. We are still struggling today on getting various levels of permission on MAXcel from KT. Representative from KT’s Commercial Department have attended meetings with our client and auditors but failed to deliver to promised timescales which has left the Project Team very open to criticism and receiving strong letters about our non-compliance with the contract. As a Group/Business we need to come up with a standardised timesheet to capture everyone’s hours, including overtime. This was a little slow to start with but has been since been addressed and fully complied with on site. To ensure this is undertaken on a timelier basis it should be considered that the electronic timesheet must be completed first thing on a Monday morning once logged in before allowing you to progress any further; a number of our competitors have this system in place. Whilst site understood the Compete4 process it was not always apparent that KT understood the difference between urgent and non-urgent items. With a number of late changes in the programme at the Client’s request, Compete4 does not allow for this reactive flexibility. It was unclear why some sub-contractors we have used previously who performed well were not awarded some of the sub-contract packages; instead these were awarded to other companies who were neither the cheapest nor the best. Mark Simpson was assigned to the scheme which has been a great help. If he had of been made available a few weeks earlier this would have been better. A feedback questionnaire for the tree felling sub-contractor was completed and sent back in a timely manner. There have been numerous E-mails and a meeting with the Security Firm (Proficient Security Ltd) about their poor performance, despite the negative feedback given, they were still maintained on site and the feedback rather than being acted upon was decided by our Group Security Manager. There are a few sub-contractors and Professional Services questionnaires that are to be returned, comment was made that despite this being undertaken on a previous scheme about a poor performing contractor and a note for them not to be used again, this advice was ignored. This has a resultant effect of the site team questioning if their comments will be taken on board or considered. This area and process needs a major review from a Group level. We have been told by KT to allow a 3 week period for this, yet in reality we are waiting on average 4-5 weeks for cheques / BACS payments. Cheques are being lost internally or payments being claimed to have been paid when they have not been. We recently just avoided a CCJ for payment unpaid since April this year. Rightly or wrongly, some individuals have been driven to making payments to the councils from their own credit cards as payments are taking so long. This situation has been further exasperated by Peter Tobin not paying these in petty cash in a prompt manner which has resulted in a dampened morale from some individuals on site who are not going to be as helpful going forwards. On previous schemes we have been able to set up an order with a Local Authority or Statutory Body and then been able to make payments on a call off basis. This same process was requested by site but rejected by KT for some unknown reason. For smaller sums I believe a Company Credit card was issued to site or used on previous schemes, again, this option was requested but not available to us. Free issue materials have been identified on IFC drawings, although some of these drawings have come through after we started works. Earlier engagement with the Statutory Undertakers would have been beneficial in this case but was prevented by the Client not allowing us to liaise directly with the SU’s from the outset. There are only a couple of long lead items which were adequately identified at the outset and we do not envisage any programme delays resulting from these."
"Did we understand requirements of DCO / Previous experience? Able to use existing relationships established within LA’s, EA, Highways Officers/Inspect ors? More dialog with client’s representatives ? AOB. The DCO is not a short or easy document to understand, that aside we carefully took the time to read it and understood our duties and obligations. What didn’t help the process is that there were people from the Client who had an 18 month head start on it over us yet they were still uncertain on some of the requirements. We do feel that we have been used as a “guinea pig” for the main CAT 1 works with the way we have developed the plans and consents and our approach to achieving these. There were inconsistencies between the DCO and the Code of Construction Practice (CoCP) Part A & B documents. We were very much kept at arms distance from the Statutory Bodies and Third Parties by our Client at the start of the scheme. After a period of time TTT realised the benefits of allowing us to engage and attend these meetings and this was a turning point in building and establishing relationships with the various parties which proved beneficial to the programme. An example of this is where we liaised with the City of London about a S61 for Blackfriars Bridge, to which we were told that one was not required. Our Client refused to listen to this and over 3 months later the Client accepted that we were correct, this is one of many examples where valuable time has been lost by not allowing us to engage earlier and directly with the key parties. TTT have attended numerous meeting with a number of the Local Authorities (LA’s) to which we were generally not invited to. From these meetings there were no minutes produced or notes passed on to us from the meetings we did not attend, so various promises and commitments were made on our behalf that we were unaware of. Of the meetings we did attend we produced our own minutes and distributed these but there was no formal recognition or confirmation of receipt from the parties. A number of the documents that we produced for consents to be sent to the LA’s were reviewed by the TTT Team and some of these were amended but we were not sent the amended or final version nor were we told when these were sent which made tracking down of documents a timely process and uncoordinated. From the start of the contract TTT had a good consents Team in place who were proactive and understood the processes. 2 months through the contract TTT changed their Consents Team by bringing in new individuals and bolstering the team. This had an adverse effect by the individuals having to go through the same learning process and establish relationships. We had a number of documents that had been approved by the First Consents Team, yet the new Consents Team requested a large amount of changes which conflicted with what the first consents team wanted including. This brought about numerous revisions of documents as well as delays in time due to various reviews not being undertaken within the contracted timeframe. We attended various consents meetings but there were rarely any minutes from these distributed and when they were they were often full of errors and did not reflect what was agreed at the meetings. It was suggested to the JMS Project Team to maintain our own register of what was sent, by who to whom and when and any revisions. This was not adopted from the outset and a few months into the scheme this task was undertaken but took a lot of time which could have been avoided by adopting this process from the outset. During this scheme a number of the original templates of documents has been changed, probably due to feedback from the various parties as well as decisions within TTT. These templates have often not been forwarded on to us or been notified to us so when we have sent in documents to TTT and some LA’s they have been rejected because they were in the wrong/old format. This could have been easily avoided and again cost us valuable time. TTT have had a large turnover of staff within their organisation and some of these individuals have differing levels of expertise and knowledge. Their processes were not fully established nor communicated and it was this that caused differing opinions and further delays. There is a 2 week review period under the contract for documents yet some early examples included our documents being sent to 3-4 different departments who each took 1-2 weeks to review – again this added significant delays to the production and submission of our consents. Letter drops and general communication with the public and businesses who were to be affected by our works was an area where again there were a number of individuals each with different opinions. We drafted a number of letter for TTT to review and were criticised for putting in too much information which was then removed. When we posted the letters we were then being criticised by residents for not giving them enough information."
"Sufficient resource – Andy Pucci? Compliance with key dates and clients requirements on level of information provided? AOB. At the outset we did not have a planner in place and were heavily reliant upon Andy Pucci. Andy had other commitments abroad and this resulted in us being a little slow to submit our Clause 31 programme by the required deadline. Etienne O’Sullivan has stepped up well to the mark to take on the planning role and has established a good rapport with the Client’s planner. The sequencing of the tender programme where it showed us commencing all of the consents at the same time was not practical and needed revising quite early on. In some of our earlier programmes we developed, we submitted these to the Client before the first programme had been accepted so were in a sense “showing our hand” too early to the Client. We have been guilty (but only because it is our nature to want to get the job done) of starting some activities without a PMI or agreed variation in place. We do however believe that it is this that has stood us in good stead with this and other clients by wanting to get on with the job and minimise delays. We feel we have a good trusting relationship with our client and that he will honour the works we have undertaken. A different client may take a different approach so it should be on a project by project basis."
"Sufficient resource? Correct level of detail and understanding of clients requirements? AOB. We felt there was good support from the outset, with Rob Harty leaving, Eugene Clerkin was brought on board for a good handover, and this has continued to date by reinforcing the team with Graham Davies and Orla Folan. The recent departure of Michael Dalton has left a little void for support to the Team but believe this is now resolved with Maria Manning and Tony Simmons taking up this role. We set a high standard by insisting that all personnel on site (in the working area) must be equipped with full PPE. This has been rolled out to all sites and included visitors who have complimented us on our standards. It was generally felt that the majority of individuals had the sufficient training to be able to undertake their duties. An issue remains over access to training records and having an up to date matrix of everyone’s training details and expiry date – this would appear to be a Group wide issue. There was a recent incident where an employee had to miss 1 day of a 5 day course due to a family bereavement and the individual was told they will now need to re-sit the whole course again in February. This is an internal course and needs to be investigated and addressed. The standard of RAMS at the outset was a little inconsistent but has vastly improved. The engagement of the foremen when compiling the RAMS is paramount and has proved beneficial to get their buy in and ownership to the activity. The Client has changed the “goalposts” of the RAMS on more than one occasion but we have reacted positively to this."
"Sufficient resource? Brian O’Connell? Luke Hands? Daniel Goodhand? Correct level of detail and understanding of clients requirements?AOB. It was noted that in the first few months that the Environmental Team were a little under resourced and could have done with an additional 1-2 members to the Team. Group lent us an individual who was to assist us from his previous experience but this turned out not to be too beneficial to the project. It may have been under estimated at tender stage on the volume of documents that were to be produced. We had to employ specialist consultants to help with the production of some of the plans, It was agreed that earlier engagement with these would have been beneficial. From previous experience with Section 61 applications, we found the S61’s on this contract were far more onerous and was subjected to numerous Client reviews, each with their own view, terminology and suggestions on grammar which caused prolonged periods for production and excessive reviews. A question was asked to why we do not look as a Group to invest in equipment and training to enable us to have the in-house capability to undertake a number of these pieces of work rather than paying external consultants. Can this please be discussed with Stephen Marr and fed back to the site team."
"Liz Coggins? Project E-mail address used? SharePoint? Other system or method? Liz was a great asset to the team but early on she left without any prior warning. We managed to replace her with Kerry Dixon but Kerry only stayed for around 8 weeks. We then employed Hilda Murphy through an agency. With all the transitions and the pace the scheme was moving at we did struggle to ensure we were compliant with our own systems. This was not helped by the fact that the Client’s Document Controller was not too receptive to meeting us on a regular basis to keep on top of issues and ensure no documents were “lost in the system”, which unfortunately did occur on a number of occasions and caused delays to submissions of consents etc. and delayed our works. Initially this was used but as the scheme has progressed and with the absence of Liz Coggins this has now slipped. Some individuals are still complying with this. This is a Business Collaborator system used by the Client. There have been numerous ongoing difficulties for a number of the site team making the system difficult to use and very time consuming."
"Sufficient space? Costs to set up – electricians? Sewer connection. Project E-mail address and contact lists. We inherited the offices that were previous used by J. Browne Construction as it was an established set up and avoided various permissions from the DLR for bringing in our own units. We initially believed there to be sufficient office space, however the client has brought more people to site than was originally envisaged and we have brought in 4 further offices to accommodate the project Team. Parking is of concern, although we were fortunate to be given an extra parcel of land by the railway which provided approx. an additional 15-20 car parking spaces. Due to the nature of our workforce and the difficulty with car/van sharing, this has not been possible and hence the larger volume of vehicles on site than we would normally have. When we looked to originally buy the offices we were quoted by Seamus McCabe that it would require 2 electricians for 3 days. This turned out with us having 2-3 electricians for 4+ weeks. Cabins delivered from KT had to be re[1]wired which is not how it should be, as this was charged to the scheme. Going forwards we should look to get a quote from the Electricians for a site set up and get a quote from an outside company as we do not believe we are getting the best value for money, which is what we have to demonstrate to our Client. An earlier effort to have connected the office complex up to a sewer rather than relying on a sceptic tank would have been more easily constructed and been quicker and cheaper as well as avoiding a few very close issues where we would not have been able to use the facilities. A dedicated Project E-mail address was set up at the outset of the scheme but this has not been used by all. The purpose of this is in the event an individual leaves the contract or a laptop gets stolen we still have the information to hand. A similar proposal was put forward to have a contacts list for all the representatives we are dealing with from various organisations. Again, this has not been maintained and is a useful reference document, that in the event someone is ill or leaves the scheme that we have these details."
"IT? Adherence to FORS & prior notification? AOB. The “support” from IT Support has been extremely poor. We requested phone lines back in the middle of March and are still waiting for them with no confirmed date yet. We have had massive issues with connectivity of broadband and wireless as well as continuing ongoing issues with connectivity to printers and the plotter. Numerous appointments have been made for IT to come to site to resolve issues and a large number of these appointments have not been adhered to, without prior notification (Sean Hamill is a repeated offender). We had to use an IT system (Symology) in order to comply with raising certain street works notices. We were reliant upon our Power Division helping us out with this and it took a number of months for the IT department to sort out a spare laptop for us with the required permissions. As a result of this ongoing delay we incurred a number of fines for late notices and were not able to respond in a timely manner as the representative in Power was either too busy or on leave – not ideal. We had strict conditions for deliveries to site with vehicle compliance to FORS. On a number of occasions we had vehicles from KT turning up without having completed the upfront paper works and a number of these vehicles were not compliant with FORS. We ordered a breaker for a mini digger from KT and the wrong one was sent out, as have other incorrect items of plant. We recently requested a 2T mini digger was returned to KT, we were quoted by KT it would be £600 for a beavertail lorry to come out from KT and collect it. This is not a competitive rate and does not align with Hewden’s, One Call or a number of our competitors and we are at risk of our client disallowing these costs. The condition of a number of items of JMS plant is poor in comparison to our competitors and hire firms yet we are often being charged an enhanced rate – needs a review at Group level – poor support. There have been issues with mobile phones on the Vodafone network, this has taken around 4-5 months to resolve and get certain individuals transferred to the O2 network. Despite this happening 2 members of staff are currently without a phone as IT do not have any spare handsets whilst their phones are being unlocked. They have not had a phone now since 13-11-15 – this is unacceptable. We are using software prescribed by the Client for the contractual administration of the contract called CEMAR. It is a very useful and user friendly piece of software and a number of high profile clients are adopting this. It was proposed in a Bright Idea for JMS to look into using this software but the feedback and response from KT was not encouraged which has left the individual who raised this feeling a little disillusioned."
Good communication / Rapport / Integration? A good relationship has been formed with our Client due to the hard working nature of the people on site and their commitment to the scheme and getting the job done. This has been slightly overshadowed by our lack of support from KT and poor commercial performance and this was reflected in the client’s feedback questionnaire with a score of 4/10. Other Clients and on other scheme’s we may not be so lucky with our lack of support and don’t believe the Clients patience would be as accommodating as it has been on this scheme.
"GPR / Stat packs – In House capability. It has been recognised that we have been on previous schemes and have done so on this scheme spent a considerable amount of money on Professional Services for the production of Stat Packs and service location plans etc. It has been asked why JMS don’t look to undertake this in-house and set up a Group Survey Team? Can someone please look into this? There was mention about how much we are using VACex’s, on Cross Rail and also on TTT. A question was raised if we have considered producing a business case to see if the company can purchase one of these units and it can be hired out to the various schemes, and when not in use with the company it could be hired out externally."
"General General Kentish Town – IT Department Kentish Town – Commercial Department In general it is very apparent that the Site Team have undertaken some great work with a very determined “We can do” attitude which promotes and lives the company’s beliefs and values. There have been some frustrations where the Clients Team are unsettled internally and not communicating and we are unfortunately being caught up in this. We do believe that by being allowed to attend the various meetings earlier on in the process and having more direct contact with the individual parties that we could have brought further efficiencies and programme savings than have currently been realised. The main cause for concern that does need to be raised and addressed is the severe lack of support from Kentish Town in the majority of departments. The IT support has been a real hindrance and a view to outsourcing site set ups and support should be given serious consideration. The commercial support from KT has been extremely poor, this has caused upset in an otherwise good working relationship with our client and has resulted in us having approximately £300-400k of costs withheld from payment to date. The Client has written 2 strong letters to us on how we are not complying with the contract and has threatened to put their own staff in our office to undertake our forecasts from Mid-December if we do not address the ongoing issues since March this year. In summary, a number of the frustrations for the project Team are being generated by the root cause of KT’s failings and lack of support. This is of great concern and carries a high risk of individuals reaching the end of their tether and may result in them seeking an alternative employer"
More time taken than anticipated however additional resources added to ensure programme maintained
As site was de-gassed entirely during shutdown – fabrication adntesting carried out on site. Reduced logistics and permitry.
"Design by NG, certain details highlighted to NG requiring design change highlighted by JMS prior to commencement of works. Early notification reduced impact and help maintain programme which NG appreciated, if not identified could have resulted in slippage."
Temporary works design in place for all activities. System / process subject of NG audits - all good.
"Sufficient direct labour to complete the works. No site manager dedicated to project, used HS adviser doubled up as site manager. Knowledgeable/trained/ direct work force - all good. Generally worked well however, should not be ideally repeated. Though the project on a whole was a success. Put more pressure on foreman and H&S advisor to do their job."
"On project close down plant returns and site to site transfers could have been better. Mostly JMS plant utilised. Additional charges to project due to site to site transfers not being completed correctly, This is repetitive on many project close outs, ample admin resources should be available to complete the correct process for more effective/efficient close out. Worked well."
Did not work out that good initial issues with QC. And 2no loads sent back.
"All work generally completed by direct labour, no major sub cons used Phased array, Radiography – all good. Laggging and insulation subbie- could have done with more resources and would have completed work in a week quicker but quality of work good."
"All DCNs managed well. All extras/CEs closed out promptly. As per NG/JMS procedures, not JMS design so no major learning."
No major issues raised .Used regular welders hat JMS use often minimal repairs.
No major accidents or incidents .Incident with valve slipping in slings/sling tore when rotating to the vertical position. Full time H&S advisor on site. Human factor - operative was trained but selected incorrect sling for the job. Incident was a HiPo. Have fed back to valve supplier on the way valves are delivered and the inclusion of more lifting lugs and anwritten procedure from the supplier on how to rotate to the vertical safely – awaiting formal fed back? Project did not call for a full time presence but in hindsight a project of this scale should have a fulltime HS advisor allowed for.
Programme has been followed and dates have slipped due to NG implications. NG-Delay on Stem Extension Clarification NG-Decision on plug Valve type. Could we have guided the client better and aided there decision making process quicker.
Procurement/Expedite contract only[1]Handover from tender had poor structure due to departure of Mick Connell (no clear filing and handover at tender stage) .Better filling at tender stage in the material file structure format and the spreadsheet has been revised to include quotation detail.
Data sheet and information from NG was not collated thoroughly and signed off by NG quick enough resulting in a CE from RMA. Stem Lengths CE by RMA[1]The cost of the CE was responded to by JMS and 25% of the original CE was paid by JMS with NG taking 25% and RMA swallowing there 50%.

Order placed with RMA and Flowserve. RMA- this has proved difficult in some areas as we have dealt with a UK representative of RMA in Germany. Information flow is sometimes miscommunicated and decisions made by RMA Germany without consultation. Flowserve contract has gone smoothly. Initial meeting should include representative for country of supply with clearer reporting lines.
Communication with NG has been positive from management to expediting staff. JMS reacted quickly when storage details changed from NG and sort hermetically sealing the valves to ensure the quality when stored long term. Joint expedition visit with NG for first round of pressure test. PMI issued by NG to implement this and JMS completed this in good time.
RMA Germany had instances where ITP was not followed. Data books have been slow to come across. Our expediter pick up on these filings and stated these to RMA. Closer monitoring by JMS.
N/A Procurement/Expedite contract only .Safety procedures followed on factory visits to suppliers and lifting plans completed for deliveries.
N/A Procurement/Expedite contract only. RMA follow procedure for disposal after manufacture.
"Job started a week late and finished on time with programme,"
"Resource of general operatives was specified, however the general operatives were required to have banksman tickets, and the machine operatives should have had lifting ops. Next time previous to the Core weekend, a walk out should be held with designer, subcontractor and walk out of the job and how it shall be completed. Should we have a whiteboard meeting before the Core possession, to discuss and ensure that all operatives that are working have basic and specified competencies required for the possession? Why the Core possession was planned on the same weekend as 3 other Core possessions."
"Procurement were much delayed in getting materials to site, most of which was sorted by the site. This could have effected massively on the programme. Fire extinguishers were delivered 3 weeks into the job. Ensure smaller generic materials are coming through the P card such as water, diesel. Etc."
"The design was over designed e.g. the form work and foundation slabs, would they be needed if a block wall was used instead? Use a block wall instead of the form work. This would have cut down on fumes."
Murphy Plant performed well and turned up on time. Could things such as de-fib be included in the Site set up?
Site team were not involved in Pre-construction.
Sidings. NR could have understood more around what the project included and check into how to get around the access and egress.
Site was tight – Small and not to the expected standards. Do not agree to use a site that is too small.
"The Project was delivered on time, to pour 400 cubic square meters of concrete in 2 weeks was achieved. Segregation between the pedestrians, plant and road was well lit. Hydrogen gas tower lights, 0 emissions, 0 noise. Good initiative from Site team to engage extractor fan to manage fumes."
"Confined Space – NR provided a site that was not adequate enough. The area was on a bend, there was very little TM aloud for in the price of the job. More of the car park should have been used. Double Stack Cabins?"
"Good progress on site ensuring works were delivered on programme. All works completed during 2 x 54 hour blockades with no over runs. Overall programme was truncated to allow delivery of the scheme to utilise the blockades that were available – whole team worked together to price the design phase, deliver the design, price the works then complete the works. Total programme form receiving remit to completing site works was 6 months. Try to deliver designs faster moving forwards to allow works to be undertaken sooner. Utilise OROTR blockades where possible to deliver works quickly and efficiently."
"Method of work was innovative – the site was a single line so an engineering train could not be utilised. Adjacent existing raised platform was used with tracked dumpers carting muck and materials to and form and compound. This was similar to having a train adjacent to the works which helped with outputs .• Try to utilise engineering trains where possible, or simulate engineering trains using similar approaches to that used at Rose Grove to help with outputs."
"Turned design round very quickly – 5 weeks from survey findings to AFC . Value engineering – reduced number of catchpits and change of pipe specifications. Levels raised to negate need for significant temporary works (trench support). Construction team involved throughout the design process – including surveys, design review meetings etc .  Poor quality initial surveys resulted in construction team getting involved in surveys. This ensured correct info was recorded and helped with successful delivery of the works.  Use Rose Grove as an example to turn design around much quicker going forwards • Try to use twinwall pipe in future if agreed by Client as this is faster to install and offers cost saving • Levels to be considered during design phase to make sure the dig is minimised as much as possible. Construction team to be involved during surveys and design on all future schemes to ensure correct information is recorded to build the scheme."
Resource deployed to site worked well to achieve shift targets to deliver the scheme. The same labour force was maintained throughout the works which ensured consistency. Site Manager to take ownership of resource and ensure resource levels are managed throughout the construction phase to generate cost efficiencies where possible.
All plant organised well in advance of blockades. Mecalec broke down briefly during first weekend blockade but was fixed quickly by on site fitter.  Some items of plant hired from Murphy Plant were not removed on time and the project incurred a cost for leaving plant on the land owner’s land beyond the agreed license period. This was despite the off-hire requests being submitted over 2 weeks prior to the requested off-hire date. Site Manager to be involved early and organise plant in good time prior to works . Fitters to be on site on all shifts to ensure any breakdowns can be fixed quickly and efficiently.  Murphy Plant to improve in their management of it’s suppliers and manage off-hires better.
All materials organised well in advance of blockades . All materials procured within the allowances set out in the tender. Left over aggregate (approx. 60 tonne) left on site for land owner so no disposal costs incurred for this left over material . Site Manager to be involved early and organise materials in good time prior to works • QS and PM to manage materials budget throughout the scheme in conjunction with buyers.
No major sub-contractor packages.
"No change control/scope changes during works • No EWNs • Ditch element was de-scoped prior to starting on site by Client .• Client asked us to reduce our costs to meet their budget – we were able to do this by value engineering (change in pipe spec and reduced number of catchpits) • Ensure tender is as accurate as possible to ensure no requirement for scope change • Work collaboratively with Client to ensure scope changes are minimised, or if required are agreed in principle quickly • Work closely with Client to ensure our tenders meet their budget wherever possible."
No quality issues raised during works or during handover walkout • No NCRs raised • Ensure god quality works on al future schemes • Good engineering supervision throughout schemes.
"Good standard of welfare and site set[1]up. Site compound was in a long, thin area so space was at a premium. • The site was well maintained • Site set-up in accordance with the standard site set-up leading to good first impressions. Suitable sixed compound area to be in advance during project development phase."
• No ecology risks identified prior to works or during works • Ecology survey to be undertaken on all sites during development phase. Ensure appropriate exclusion zones are established when required. Adhere to Local Authority requests if made to maintain good relationship.
• Land access turned around very quickly by Client • Work closely with Client to allow the to organise land access as quickly as possible • Utilise Network Rail land wherever possible to avoid need for third party land • Maintain good relationships with railway neighbours at all times to ensure collaboration between all parties.

N/A Procurement/Expedite contract only. Safety procedures followed on factory visits to suppliers and lifting plans completed for deliveries.
N/A Procurement/Expedite contract only . RMA follow procedure for disposal after manufacture.
"Some locations were very remote & access was difficult, resulting in delay to programme. Pre-tender site visits would have identified the problems & allowed sufficient time on programme to access the digs."
"No real problems .NG were locating weld positions from pigging information, sometimes these were up to 10m out."
All TWD carried out in-house.
Each site has an SCO91 trained permit holder .Maybe look into getting a few more experienced foreman on the SCO list.
Majority of plant from Ollerton. Expensive transport costs to South Wales & not always the most up to date plant.
"Lead times in placing orders is far too long. Even though companies are on the AVL, it still takes far too long to get orders set up."
"Data book information .More time needs to be spent during the contract to ensure data book preparation/entries are ongoing throughout the project, not a mad panic at the end."
Site Set-up & Welfare Facilities. Need to look into better welfare & office facilities on site.
"Under estimation of controls needed to some of the digs .Pre works visits should have highlighted some of the issues we encountered. Ensure jobs are completed & signed off before leaving site. One site we had to return to & re-divert a watercourse we altered initially, this should have been done before we demobilized."
Progress on site was initially slow due to the discovery of deep peat on site which meant Natural Resource Wales (NRW) needed to be involved for the removal. This impacted heavily on programme delaying the end of the contract. Programme updates were dealt with directly between the Project Manager and Programmer (Paul Aylett). Allocation Sheets were produced in a timely manner by the site supervisor phoning the PM on a daily basis and running through the sheets. This was then handed over to the site supervisor to fill in once he was accustomed to the format required. These were then emailed to the NG Supervisor on a weekly basis for sign off. A working relationship was struck between JMS and Jones Bros which allowed the peat to be collected by Jones Bros wagons and redistributed within their CDM area. This meant Jones Bros were able to satisfy NRW with their peat management and allow JMS to continue with ground remediation. This allowed JMS to complete the work ahead of schedule. Being able to organize a day to sit down 1 – 1 with the planner in the offices worked really well. It allowed the PM to see the programme being updated in real time and make sure it was an accurate reflection of the works on site. This worked really well as it made sure all personnel were fully aware what was going on and avoided disputes when commercial issues arose.
Site setup space was limited and it was only due to the generosity of VattenFalls that costly additional/remediation work was avoided. No engineer was available for the project to set out as such it was left to the site team to set the compound out. Fortunately the positioning of it was not critical. Better evaluation of the available space at tender is required in order to help Project Managers plan the works and not get caught out as this could have cost a vast amount of money given the restrictions imposed within the area. Availability of engineers should have been highlighted earlier on.
Premtech were the civil designers and were available to discuss issues arising from the drawings and were able to quickly sort any issues. Need to evaluate drawings more closely before issue to client as found that air entrained concrete had been specified which is extremely expensive when concrete cubes are required. Design process was not clear from the client which meant even though we are aware of G35 process which will result in misunderstandings in data book expectations. The fact that JMS owned the design and had employed Premtech to complete the drawings made life very simple when changes were required. Moving forward with Premtech make sure no air entrained concrete is specified to avoid costly testing procedures. Get confirmation in writing from the client with respect to the requirements of data books ahead of project commencement.
Need to establish internally what are the minimum requirements for TWC and TWS. This arose when questioned during a site audit it appeared competency matrix did not recognize the course the TWS had sat and therefore raised an issue. Inconsistent approach from client with respect to what counts as temporary works. i.e a towable cabin positioned with its legs on the ground doesn’t count. However netlon fencing is to be recorded. Identify during tender or site establishment the people who have the correct training and authorize them to hold the TWC and TWS positions. Establish a list of works that are classed as temporary works and what period of inspection is required.
Due to the internal restructure with our Core Skills Matrix it transpired quite a few personnel fell short of the position they were holding on site this meant that when the training and competence matrices were generated it highlighted gaps which were picked up by National Grid during an Audit. Ensure adequate training has been provided to all personnel to minimize gap actions.
Plant and equipment were scheduled so only full wagons were sent to the job and when collecting plant which helped minimize transportation costs. Plant and equipment were delivered in a timely manner to the job from all suppliers. Speak to Plant & Transport sometimes it is worth seeing what other transport is in the area as it is possible to put equipment on a wagon for another project if it is passing by. Planning the works and building relationships helped work with the programme.
Due to the restrictions of stone to be used on the project enforced by NRW it made the purchasing of stone for the project difficult due to the supplier not being on our system. This meant we had to pay a middle company extra money for handling the logistics. Look into the fact that our framework agreement should have minimal % uplift on materials as the only reason this didn’t financially hurt the project was the fact that it.
Subcontractors Corrpro submitted a revised quotation for the works which was not passed on to the client when submitting the quotation. Leading Edge Technology were very accommodating and provided good documentation and training information before being on site. Ensure latest quotations are submitted to the client to keep costs accurate. Keep contact with Leading Edge and develop a relationship if similar future works from NG are issued.
Client decided that due to the number of variations submitted by JMS to NG that there was not enough money allocated to the project and insisted that a cost reimbursable format was adopted moving forward. This potentially limited the profit of the project to 10%. enough money allocated to the project and insisted that a cost reimbursable format was adopted moving forward. This potentially limited the profit of the project to 10%. In tender clarifications ensure that the way the project change format is set in stone to avoid confusion on whether this is to be via quotations or cost reimbursable.
Due to weather conditions on site a concrete pour was at risk of needing to be broken out (in the end the finished product and results were fine) .Highlights the importance of checking the weather reports prior to ordering concrete.
Welfare facilities were provided by Eco Welfare which was a towable 10 man cabin. This was ample and extremely versatile On small projects make sure these are used as they are of a very good standard would be ideal if they were included on our Framework agreement to try and save money.
Would have been handy to conduct trial holes prior to site establishment to identify if peat was present. Trial holes prior to work starting are becoming ever more critical as ground condition clauses are usually omitted and can leave us vulnerable to costs.
"This project used a previous contract number which made things very confusing when managing multiple aspects of the job incl. plant, costings and materials. Suggest if a previous contract number is to be used for speed a subsequent letter or number is used to help distinguish differences."
"Tree felling and vegetation clearance works outside Bird Nesting season March to August. Good use of Subcontractor’s for specialist works. Good use of programme, avoided the nesting birds season, applied lessons learned from previous projects within Scotland. Good use of programme, avoided the nesting birds season, applied lessons learned from previous projects within Scotland."
"Surveying & Setting out. H&S Inspections. Poor IT facilities on site. 2 No. Welfare units –For site offices. Controlled by design drawings and position of the Gas pipeline, centre the bays over the mains. JMS internal H&S inspections throughout the project. Provide site printers for scanning & printing facilities to make on site admin easier. ( SM had to travel circa 2.5 hours one way to print and scan delivery dockets etc). Worked well for site accommodation, logistic issues with cleaning of the units still continued."
Palisade Fence to CE3 Specification. Client issue with G35 design paperwork. Faster fence system compared to weld mesh of previous projects. This resulted in JMS completing circa 75% of the works this year and fully demobbing from site ahead of remobilisation in the summer of 2016.
"All designs were CAT 0 or CAT 1. Track Mats utilised for service crossing over the mains as opposed to bog matts. JMS procedure worked well, robust to NG audits. Proved easier to transport between the two sites with the remote/rural nature of the works."
"Visiting H&S Advisor and Environmental Advisor. JMS crews not suited to fencing works. JMS SCO Resources. Worked well on the project, visited 2 days a month. All documentation in place this will allow the data books to be closed out in timely manner once completed hot taps works. Productivity rates were slow initially this should increase going forward on future projects as project used a learning curve for operatives. Well manned with a number of permit holders, which gave flexibility on site when a number of permits were in issued."
"Mostly external hired plant utilised due to rural nature of the sites and distance from a JMS depot. Remote testing of the concrete for CE1 specification worked well. Worked well, some logistic issues with collection dates from sites. Worked well, allowed JMS to better utilise the resources on site."
"Gas items procured in good time and fabrication completed and stored in Ollerton ready for outage next year. Locker & Bain Fence Material supply only. Lead time on fence materials 5 weeks reduced to 3 weeks of some fence materials. Worked well. Faultless product and clear lines of communication between L&B and SM. Due to lateness of PO, L&B expedited the manufacture and delivery of some of the standard items of fence, to allow JMS keep on programme."
"QS followed JMS procedures immaculately, no issues or kick back from procurement. Security. First Horizon. MACAW Engineering. AUGHTON Automation. This had a positive effect on the smooth running of the project. Appollo security worked well, no issues. Recommended to work on other JMS sites. GPR & Topographical Survey – was completed to a good standard also installed Survey Control points to allow JMS set out correctly. Sample of live gas pipework, crew worked well and efficient. Supplied control cabinets, and Type J Kiosks."
"Good use of EWN. Document control. Mitigated delays, lead to increased contract value through PMI and CE. Worked well good working relationship between SM & DC."
Completed coating inspection in accordance with CW5. NG Audits. Good records produced and included in Data books. Throughout the project were positive most Client Audits 95-100%.
"H&S General. COSSH Boxes. Towable Welfare unit. No reportable Incidents of the duration of the project, KPI’s always submitted on time. Daily take 5’s on each operational site and weekly TBT delivered. High standard of H&S on all sites, commented on by client and reflected on both internal and external audits. Easy to transport and worked well. Easy to transport and position on small site with lack of working room, worked well for each site."
Good Waste Management. Due to resourced Environmental Advisor.
"Management of programme. Extension of the programme. The programme was well managed and monitored regularly. Challenges were overcome in relation to wayleaves, through close client liaison and helping to achieve the required permission with collaboration and open teamwork. The wayleave challenges meant an alteration of the cable route, resulting in extensions to the programme period, which was notified by EWN and agreed by CE’s with the client under the contract conditions."
Construction method Setting out Inspections. Advance Surveying. Our method of construction had to be re-assessed due to an incident of an operative dismounting a vehicle on narrow country lanes. Timely Trial hole and Surveying of existing culverts led to an early discovery of the poor condition of the culverts. This allowed us to make alternative arrangements for the cable route.
Management of subcontract designers (including communication). Design Review. Management of internal designers. Design management was carried out by the Project Manager whom determined what designs were required initially from the design schedule. Designers were then appointed 1. Malachy Walsh for the Joint bays and 2. O’Connor Utilities for the design of the horizontal drills. Designs were checked and verified by internal designer also. Civils design review was carried out by our project manager before gaining approval by the client. The design of the replacement culvert was carried out in house by our own engineers and calculations verified by other qualified engineers working on another one of our projects. The design was agreed fit for purpose by our project manager and the water board engineers.
TWC Suitability of Temporary Works Hoardings .Project Manager managed the temporary works such as fencing & joint bays in compliance with current Temporary Works Control Procedure MOH0001-PRO-00031.
"Labour ,Staff Competence, Training, Experience. There were no issues with our staffing / labour levels or competency and training."
"Traffic management hire Herts. Some items of equipment had to be externally sourced such as 21 tonne tipper lorries, due to the location of the project in relation to our own plant depots in Kentish Town. This required us to acquire a licence to park plant and equipment over night at our site depot. Products were well maintained and supplied on time, however their delivery and collection paper work was not up to standard, leading to misunderstanding about what was collected and when."
"Storage. Surplus / Wasted Materials. Storage was mainly for client free issue materials such as ducts, stockboards and cable. Cable storage became an issue as the client requested us to store the cable drums upon delivery, prior to installation requiring secure stable storage areas. This entailed us producing an EWN followed by a CE which was agreed at the time. This was never an issue due to the fact that we called off our materials as and when required for the works. Such as CBS, type 1 fills concrete and reinstatement materials. This led to very little surplus or wasted material."
Lead times. Competence & Experience. JMS IT department service provider took three months to provide IT connection to our site depot. This was wholly unacceptable as we were on site working without proper IT site set up. Eco Drill our HDD subcontractor were very professional in their set up and construction of our required HDD. Their competency and efficiency led to an early completion of the HDD.
"Understanding of contract / client requirements. Administration of contract Change control (including time bar). Communication, progress meetings. Project team had a very good understanding of the contract and clients requirements. We utilised the client’s change of control documents under NEC 3 contract such as EWN Early warning notices & CE Compensations Events. Regular progress meeting were scheduled and held with JMS, the client and third parties. This collaboration ensured that everyone involved was kept abreast of developments, ensuring any issues could be discussed and resolved at an early stage."
"Non-conformance. Quality site inspection. 4 no. Non conformances were raised during the project. 1. IT Provider Redstone 2. Supplier Brett 3. Compliant Register 4. Decal stamp on drawings. The inspection looked at all aspects of JMS procedures forms and was good overall, except for NCR 3 and 4 listed above."
"Welfare Facilities. Incidents. Working areas were provided with sufficient welfare facilities, including site compound which were both maintained. 1 number accident (RIDDOR) occurred due to insufficient working space in the narrow country lanes. Our method of work, while in the narrow country lanes, was immediately changed to ensure adequate working space was provided."
Incidents. Waste Management. HDD waste management. No Environmental Incidents. Waste accumulated from the project works was well managed on site. All records of movement were updated to SMARTWaste. By product waste from the HDD was well segregated by construction of a temporary bunded area. This was removed for recycling and disposal at the completion of the drilling process.

"Easement Design – NG negotiated a 20m wide temporary easement to carry out the works. As the haul road was 4.5m in width and the trench width was approx. 2m wide the working area was greatly reduced. This also disrupted the flow of traffic up and down the haul road. The narrow working easement also effected how we could delivered the CBS into the trench. As we had to maintain a minimum designed separation between the SGT12 & 9 circuits this meant that the Vodafone pits along the route would fall outside the permanent agree Easement of 10m. This resulted in the NG land agent having to renegotiate a permanent easement of 15m wide. At the design stage we were unsure whether we were going to install Link Pillars or Link boxes. This caused us some major issues down the line with the landowners as the position of the link boxes were not discussed until late on in the project. When we submitted the design for the link boxes we had to sight the boxes in the nearest hedge/fence line to cause as little disruption to the landowners property as possible. Where practical the link boxes were put near hedge lines but in some cases the 10m max length of the onging lead to the joint was difficult to achieve. We were asked by our client to use lift assisted lids in the link box chambers. Again this is something that needs to be discussed early on to avoid having to carry out civil redesign works. This is a positive step towards the H&S of the maintenance teams who will be looking after the circuit once the construction works are complete. Design change: During the design stages it was agree that the conductor would be changed from copper to aluminium although this had a huge commercial benefit it did cause some lengthy delays with the overall designEasement Design – NG negotiated a 20m wide temporary easement to carry out the works.

Design change: During the design stages it was agree that the conductor would be changed from copper to aluminium although this had a huge commercial benefit it did cause some lengthy delays with the overall design. The electrical design had to be scrapped and started again from scratch whilst the civil ducting works were ongoing. This meant that the assurance process was difficult to comply with due to constantly playing catch up. Design for Vodafone chambers to be constructed every 250m along the route and at every change in direction was overkill. To comply with the NG approved Vodafone chamber design we had to construct a total of 74 pits along the route which added a lot of time, plant and labour that we believe was not necessary. When the cable installation team arrived on site to install the fibre they only used ½ the amount of chambers constructed. This was a waste of time and money. Twin circuit design: having the ducting in the same trench sped up the production during the install. Design: The overall layout for the under track crossing was not in the correct scale on the strip map drawings. This meant that the easement width and fencing were incorrect. Design: The scaffolding design for the CSE ends require the first floor of the scaffold to be 500mm below the top of the CSE structure. During the installation a prefabricated stairs was used this meant that the scaffold was only approx. 300mm below the top of the CSE structures. Instead of using sheet piles or timbering out the jointbay we designed a battered/stepped jointbay. This saved us both time and cost on the project. The bonding leads were designed to enter the link box at a horizontal position at the front of the box. This meant that when the cables exited they were only 600mm Below EGL. Actual Hedge lines are not accurate to the DWG drawings. Design interface: The CSE structures at trackside are in very close proximity to the HAM units. This caused some difficulties when it came to testing and MEWP access. The sump positions in the link boxes were design off to one side. When the beams to carry the lids were installed this made it difficult to drop a pump into once the lids were installed. The positions of some of the jointbays at hedge lines made it difficult to construct as there was some water course in close proximity. There was no detailed design produced for the earth of the jointbays/link boxes at the early stages. This caused issues with the subcontractor later on. Site walk and final positioning of the cable route to be carried out early on to avoid any delays with procuring cable. All surveys to be carried out early on once contract has been awarded. A more in depth Archaeological survey may have provided more information and indicated the position of the cable route to avoid sensitive areas. Detailed survey of route including ditches/depressions and road crossings would have avoided some delays with our design for installing the ducts deeper. Pre manufacturing the Vodafone chambers in the site compound help speed up the production process. The design consisted of casting in lifting hooks in the foundation of the chambers. One of the jointbay locations along the route was designed on a slope. This proved quite difficult to carry out the jointing and fill the resin into the joints at these locations. Late design of CSE structures resulted in additional costs for the project. Design Assurance. The redesign work required to change from copper to aluminium conductor and the uncertainty from NG whether we would use link boxes or link pillars resulted in the design being very late. In future project of a similar design the Easement width should be a minimum of 15m wide Permanent and 30m wide for the temporary construction. The design for the link boxes needs to be submitted early on to allow the land agents to discuss with the landowners to avoid having issues during the construction phase. Detailed drawings with actual GPS positions of the hedge lines shall be used to sight the boxes. The civil design for the link boxes should als be carried out before approaching the landowners so they know exacly what will be left in their land. Lift assited lids to be used going forward on link box lids. A huge design change such as this requires a lot of resource to output a new design. In future a change of this magnitude needs to be carried out before the construction team get on site to deliver the project. NG have challenged the specification to change it ahead of the next contract. Worked well could lay up to 700m per day with the duct trailer. Double check all drawings and dimension on subcontractors drawing to ensure scales are correct. If using a standardised staircase ensure that the ground level allows sufficient clearance to maintain the 500mm dimension. Batterer joint bays where possible. In future it would be better for the bonding leads to enter from the bottom end of the foundation so that the correct cover can be maintained. Actual GPS positions for road crossings and hedge lines should be carried out early on. Would suggest a bigger footprint for the trackside substation as this appears to be an off the shelf design. Consideration into sump location needs to be thought about early on. Relocate joint bays away from any water courses. Detailed earthing arrangements to be produced before involving subcontractor. Agreed cable route before commencing topsoil strip. Carry out surveys on contract award where possible. Survey early on. Would suggest adopting this methodology going forward. Avoid positioning joint bays on slopes. Design CSE structures earlier. Design scope to be agree early on to prevent delays with the construction..

During the installation a prefabricated stairs was used this meant that the scaffold was only approx. 300mm below the top of the CSE structures. Instead of using sheet piles or timbering out the jointbay we designed a battered/stepped jointbay. This saved us both time and cost on the project. The bonding leads were designed to enter the link box at a horizontal position at the front of the box. This meant that when the cables exited they were only 600mm Below EGL. Actual Hedge lines are not accurate to the DWG drawings. Design interface: The CSE structures at trackside are in very close proximity to the HAM units. This caused some difficulties when it came to testing and MEWP access. The sump positions in the link boxes were design off to one side. When the beams to carry the lids were installed this made it difficult to drop a pump into once the lids were installed. The positions of some of the jointbays at hedge lines made it difficult to construct as there was some water course in close proximity. There was no detailed design produced for the earth of the jointbays/link boxes at the early stages. This caused issues with the subcontractor later on. Site walk and final positioning of the cable route to be carried out early on to avoid any delays with procuring cable. All surveys to be carried out early on once contract has been awarded. A more in depth Archaeological survey may have provided more information and indicated the position of the cable route to avoid sensitive areas. Detailed survey of route including ditches/depressions and road crossings would have avoided some delays with our design for installing the ducts deeper. Pre manufacturing the Vodafone chambers in the site compound help speed up the production process. The design consisted of casting in lifting hooks in the foundation of the chambers. One of the jointbay locations along the route was designed on a slope. This proved quite difficult to carry out the jointing and fill the resin into the joints at these locations. Late design of CSE structures resulted in additional costs for the project. Design Assurance. The redesign work required to change from copper to aluminium conductor and the uncertainty from NG whether we would use link boxes or link pillars resulted in the design being very late. In future project of a similar design the Easement width should be a minimum of 15m wide Permanent and 30m wide for the temporary construction. The design for the link boxes needs to be submitted early on to allow the land agents to discuss with the landowners to avoid having issues during the construction phase. Detailed drawings with actual GPS positions of the hedge lines shall be used to sight the boxes. The civil design for the link boxes should als be carried out before approaching the landowners so they know exacly what will be left in their land. Lift assited lids to be used going forward on link box lids. A huge design change such as this requires a lot of resource to output a new design. In future a change of this magnitude needs to be carried out before the construction team get on site to deliver the project. NG have challenged the specification to change it ahead of the next contract. Worked well could lay up to 700m per day with the duct trailer. Double check all drawings and dimension on subcontractors drawing to ensure scales are correct. If using a standardised staircase ensure that the ground level allows sufficient clearance to maintain the 500mm dimension. Batterer joint bays where possible. In future it would be better for the bonding leads to enter from the bottom end of the foundation so that the correct cover can be maintained. Actual GPS positions for road crossings and hedge lines should be carried out early on. Would suggest a bigger footprint for the trackside substation as this appears to be an off the shelf design. Consideration into sump location needs to be thought about early on. Relocate joint bays away from any water courses. Detailed earthing arrangements to be produced before involving subcontractor. Agreed cable route before commencing topsoil strip. Carry out surveys on contract award where possible. Survey early on. Would suggest adopting this methodology going forward. Avoid positioning joint bays on slopes. Design CSE structures earlier. Design scope to be agree early on to prevent delays with the construction. Ensure there is some lag time between HV testing and other planned works ."
Coordination with Substation contractor. Some issues developed during the testing of the completed circuits between JMS and J2M. J2M wanted to install the final busbar connections once the HV tests were completed. Due to some over running tests the conductor resistance test had to be carried out at a later date which impacted on J2M’s programme. Ensure there is some lag time between HV testing and other planned works .
"Project budget and programme of works do not tie up. Some CE’s had an impact on the programme but this was not captured properly at the time. Archaeology works at (4.3 development stage) to be planned better to avoid additional costs to project. During some stages of the project there was a gap in monitoring the planned and actual costs. Ensure there is Synergy between the Project Budget, Programme and Scope of Works. Ensure that the full consequential and programme effect is realised within Compensation Event Values. In addition to 2, greater strategic planning is required between, Project Management, Commercial and Planning, to ensure an maximum commercial opportunity. Adoption of Weekly Cost / Programme monitoring and understanding of the variances between planned and actual."
"Production of our own CBS helped with productivity and commercially. Link boxes were procured in Australia, good commercially but not so good on delivery lead times. Originally we set up an order with Aggregate Industries for some 6F5 stone to construct the haul road. The material contained too many fines with resulted in sink age further down the line. Would suggest producing our own CBS in future projects. Suggest using a nearer supplier. Suggest using some clean broken instead of fines mixed through."
Farsight security were used at the beginning of the project but did not deliver a reliable service. Tried using agency staff to set up the site compound at the start of the project but this did not work out as they did not fully understand our client’s expectations. New security firm appointed. Do not use agency staff for future site set ups.
The programme was updated on a monthly basis but the NG PM did not sign acceptance. CE were not adequately reflected in the programme this in turn caused issues when making legitimate claims. Ensure that a meeting is held on a monthly basis to discuss the programme and CE impacts. All programme impacts for CEs should clearly show the delays to back up the claim under NEC3.
"Lorry movement letter helped with no complaints on muck away movements. Construction of Vodafone chambers in compound minimised the hazards of constructing them on site. Public Footpaths closure notices ran out before project was completed. Moderate incident on site where an excavator had the potential to infringe the safety clearance on an OHPL. Pre-fabricated steps used to enter/exit joint bays. Lorry movements, deliveries and plant movements. V Bucket, sand cart and ducting trailer avoided the unnecessary entry/exit of operatives into the trench. Access into the site compound was on a bad bend. Multiple deliveries per day. Walking areas uneven. Working under OHPL using 360 Excavators. During the works we had one incident where an excavator was used with the height restriction system not implemented. On future schemes to avoid this happening we would recommend the use of a dozer in these areas. Good practice to be adopted going forward. Good practice. Ensure that you double check closure notices and set reminders for dates. Even though the machine in this instance did not infringe the appropriate safety clearance it was agreed that further measures would be applied to mitigate any potential infringement. OHPL permits rolled out on site. Full Review of GS6 should be carried out once a month or when circumstances on site changes. Best practice for future projects. A one way system was introduced to illuminate reversing in the compound, reducing the likelihood of an incident, this is briefed at both inductions to all drivers. Best practice for future projects. Before agreeing to site establishment areas carry out a site visit. Relaxed PPE area was introduced where only Hi Viz is needed. Visitors Induction introduced highlighting prominent risks when in the compound area or visiting. Introduced tarmac footways to illuminate slips and trips. Dozer to be used to strip and reinstate topsoil under OHPL."
"Design of Bat fencing requested by Jacobs was over the top and costly. During times of heavy rain fall the silt fencing was unable to contain the run off on the hill sides. During bad weather the roads became dirty. When the excavation went too far in front of the duct installation team the trench would become water logged. This in turn meant that the bottom layer of CBS would start mixing with the water and contaminate it, which in turn meant it could not be pumped. Removing sensitive hedge rows caused issues with the bat flight path. Protection of water courses. During the works we were required to cross several water courses. In these areas we set up protection measures in the form of sand bags to prevent any contamination entering the water course. On one occasion the protection was damaged and some silty water enter the water course. On future schemes I would recommend that we build higher sand bag walls in these locations to avoid this happening. Heras fences with brash tied to the top to imitate the hedge is still in place. Ditches were dug into the hill side to redirect the water onto the adjacent grassland, silt netting added to accumulate the silt. Hired in a road sweeper during busy periods. Do not open up too much of a trench at a time when installing the CBS during wet times. Use haras panels and cammo netting to mimic existing hedge. A more robust system to be implemented for water course protection at crossing points."
No temporary works design was produced for the HDD rig at the Substation as we did not think it was required. NG later questioned the TW for the HDD and stopped works until this was in place. Always produce a TWD for the HDD rig whether it is a short drill or not.
At the start of the project we did not have a document controller on site this caused issues due to the sheer volume of paperwork being produced. Full time document controller employed. Works very well and would recommend we implement this again on a similar size project.
"When stripping the topsoil we should consider the storage location at the design stage to avoid having to double handle the material due to the present of OHPL. Storeman employed for the duration of the works to control all plant, material and COSHH distribution. Capture at design stage. This worked very well and is something that has impressed the Client."
"HSG47 training needs to be carried out by a National Grid approved body. This can take a long time. The initial workforce came from Pipelines, they did not have the required tickets and was extremely difficult to obtain the re. Murphy’s should seek guidance into getting on the approved training scheme to deliver this training in house."
The satellite dishes used at the beginning of the project were temperamental. The plotter on site did not work correctly for 1 month. Apply for BT connection as early as possible. Took plotter from WGC.
"Good working relationship with client. NG Maintenance procedure needs to be incorporated into the construction team. Weekly TP163 meetings, updates and discussions."
There were unexpected ground conditions 70m after launch – wet & sandy. Generally progress was as per the tender allowance. Shaft sinking went well – use of SCL technique proved advantageous for eye construction. JMS installed a hood on the TBM and were required to back grout to stabilise rings. Compensation event covered the additional cost of this work. Consider using SCL techniques for future shaft construction.
"Use of SCL for shaft construction was advantageous. Innovative use of steel liner plates from Dywidag in Back[1]shunt construction proved very effective. Light to handle, strong and easy to erect. Removed necessity for a shield. As above. Consider use of liner plates for future temporary works tunnels."
"Specialist mining Sub[1]contractor Tunnelcraft proved themselves very competent while constructing the 2.59m – 7,62m staged enlargement for the TBM Launch. Close relationship with client’s engineer KBR helped produce practical methods of work. Suggest use Tunnelcraft for similarly technically difficult timber mining work. Maintain close relations with clients designers and develop methodologies as a team."
Resources were used from previous contracts leading to a familiar team. There was a high turnover of Q.S’s. Try to ensure continuity of work for workforce. Ensure Q.S’s are motivated and given career development.
Close links with Tunnel Workshop. The workshop provided launch procedures and underground chamber machine assembly drawings offline. Utilisation of all JMS tunnelling plant provided savings. Project paid workshop to work offline on specific tasks. This should be repeated. Identify where JMS plant can be used and investigate procurement of new equipment rather than external hire.
No Issues .Trusted suppliers used for major procurement items where possible.
Unorthodox Clients PM led to issues with interim valuations due to verbal instructions. PM settled final account early. This led to confusion for site team .Ensure written communications back-up verbal instructions to avoid possible future dispute.
Shaft constructions in live substations were successful. Planning work was essential to ensure work was allowed to commence.
Project team had worked on installation meaning familiarity of equipment. Ensure that similar contracts have team who understand the equipment and the work environment.
"Project was delivered from existing PLUG offices initially saving office set-up time and providing cost savings. More recently, on completion of PLUG, Site team shared offices with existing client offices. JMS were able to offer a saving to the client in this case Identify other projects, depots within immediate location to avoid unnecessary establishment of new sites. Explore collaborative working with client to produce cost savings for both parties."
PM familiarity with systems persuaded client to instruct betterment of MEICA systems which was managed through project team. Additional work proved profitable. Previously used MEICA management company had ceased operating. This meant that JMS team needed to manage each equipment supplier separately. This worked well. Detailed understanding of the systems enabled site team to point out weaknesses within systems post contract award. Ensure Project team are familiar with the equipment to be maintained. Review whether external MEICA management company is required. Identify if this type of work can be managed successfully in-house as was the case here.
"Over the 3yr period, there was a large turnover of Q.S. staff with no commercial staff at times. Some maintenance operations were undertaken whilst Power B.U. & Civil’s B.U resources were undertaking their installation as part of overall PLUG scheme. These afforded shared resources with Power B.U. & Civils B.U. who were working nearby and provided more efficient utilisation of personnel. Absence of MEICA management company increased knowledge and experience of JMS team. Use of operatives from PLUG project. They were experienced with the equipment and work environment. Minimise disruption to project team mid-project. Check availability of resources on other small to medium projects nearby. Can we self deliver projects like this? In this case yes and this was demonstrated to the client who now recognises our in-house MEICA capabilities. Ensure where possible familiarity of team with work is a priority."
Sub-contracts for extended maintenance were placed with original manufacturers. However Directional Fire attempted to re-coup supply losses through high costs for their system maintenance. JMS project team were able to identify an alternative supplier to carry out necessary maintenance. Ensure that equipment suppliers can provide a good quality/value maintenance service at tender time.
Opportunities were realised e.g. the betterment of equipment discussed above. Good working knowledge of equipment necessary.
"JMS were exposed to ODA safety stand-down days, supervisor training & high-tech medical centre for the first time. Communication of incidents accidents was very good and shared between contractors. Experience gained for the future of Health & Safety. Lesson learnt for JMS as to how openness can help drive down accidents and highlight hazards."
Security checks to get onto Olympic Park towards the end of contract was very strict and required meticulous & accurate planning from project team. This was as a result of the Olympics and was time consuming for senior members of team. More so than was originally anticipated.
"Tender programme included unrealistic allowances for construction of high level tunnel. 5m allowed, 3m realistic. Tender programme also had no time allowance for secondary SCL works. Feed back to estimating team for future works."
"VALUE Engineering throughout project realised significant time cost savings. E,g, SCL upper eye, shortening of backshunt & construction of TBM forward eyes. Surface monitoring to the highways was completed in house with tunnelling BU equipment. PM was transferred from project at commencement of MEICA installations leading to reduced Management/leadership and some problems with installations, prolonged commissioning & a drawn out final integrated testing duration. Ensure Value Engineering meetings are regularly held on all future tunnel projects including cost benefit analysis. Review possibility of in-house monitoring on all tunnelling sites as it can produce efficiencies and cost savings. Ensure that adequate supervisory knowledge is maintained & available on site for completing all activities up to completion."
"Close working with client’s designer produced savings for JMS and UKPN. Use of Phil Green (MEA Associates under Donaldson’s) as MEICA designer worked very well as he has also represented UKPN previously. Necessary re-design construction methods for Taylors Lane shaft due to services. Collaborative working and good communication with client and their designer, Parsons Brinckerhoff. Ensure MEICA designer has a very good in depth knowledge of specific UKPN MEICA systems. This was identified early on and resolved in a collaborative way with the client & their designer Parsons Brinckerhoff."
Tunnels engaged with Chris Hudson in Golborne for the majority of temporary works designs and checks. This reduced scope for Donaldson and produced significant cost & time savings. Unfortunately Chris Hudson has left and so his improved knowledge of typical TW for tunnelling projects has left company. Identify suitable temporary works capabilities in[1]house for future projects. Ensure multiple TW designers within company are exposed to TW on Tunnels.
"Lack of availability of fitters at start of tunnelling had a detrimental impact on programme. Project team was multi-skilled ensuring that there was contingency in place for most key skills i.e. crane operations, banksmen, machine operators Ensure adequate fitters available for all projects if multiple projects are ongoing. Ensure contingency resource measures are is in place for all critical activities. This could be for plant also."
Investment by group in plant led to improvements in reliability and efficiency of construction. It was more economic to hire 100 tonne crawler crane and driver externally than directly through JMS P+T. From contract plant requirement schedule identify what investments could benefit the project and to what level and submit business case through the BU to John Coll for review. Provide feedback to P+T to help them ensure their prices are less than market rates.
"There was considerably less wastage of sprayed concrete than on any previous similar project. Ensure a good concrete mix, pump and operators are available for all SCL operations."
Use of a new mining labour supplier had some positives and negatives to the project. Poorer standard of supervision than JMS normally receives meant that closer supervision was required from JMS team. Sub-contractor must buy into the programme. Mining labour supplier reconciled & signed off final account in a timely manner. Sensornet price escalated from original tender due to technical substantial advancements from a previous UKPN installation. Use of new mining sub-contractor has brought greater competition to labour supply. Ensure mining labour suppliers provide competent pit bosses that drive the work process. Having priced the programme and allocated resources accordingly the subcontractor constantly complained that it was too tight to achieve the productivity required. Ensure final account is agreed as early as possible to reduce liabilities. Ensure adequate specification requirements & understanding client’s updated needs.
The site team challenged the tender risk register and re[1]apportioned risk in areas they considered different from the estimators. Administration of contract for 1st 6 months was exceptionally difficult due to poor IT connectivity on site. Administration of contract for 1st 6 months was exceptionally difficult due to poor IT connectivity on site. Ensure adequate IT communications are on site ASAP on future projects.
No major issues. Good quality management on site.
No issues & a well planned good site set up was recognised by senior management. Good proactive H+S management on site with good support from Tunnels in KT and also recognised by the client. This project team were consistently top of UKPN contractors league table for CSCS scheme. Ensure good quality welfare facilities are set up & maintained Robust Monitoring for Safety and Cultural Developement Programme in Place (TMoten). Client acknowledges JMS proactive safety record and repeat work is received.
A number of bright ideas were identified and implemented by the site team. Identify environmental initiatives throughout group and adopt. Share our initiatives via bright ideas forum.
"The client was very open to discuss design change, betterment. Water, power and communications took far too long to be established on site impacting on working practices & programme. The contract was administered in a very collaborative way. Establishing suitable communications on site seems to be a B.U. wide problem and need to be addressed. This matter has been raised at Quarterly BU head meeting."
"Tender programme allowed 20 shifts - 4 weeks & at a cost of £86,776.23 to mobilise, drill & inject the necessary ground treatment to the overlying Thanet Sands & chalk formation including proving adequacy of the works. Keller’s anticipated duration tender programme for their fissure grouting works was 13 weeks and even after adjusting their drilling & grouting methodology & also undertaking additional treatment for a forward eye & backshunt, they still completed within the allowed period UKPN changed the tunnel alignment & in turn then deepened the New Cross drive shaft by 10m which allowed JMS an opportunity undertake additional SI & also to completely re-appraise the ground treatment and add time into the contract programme. JMS invited Keller’s, Bachy & Geocisa UK. to tender the revised scope & Keller’s were adjudicate to be competitive on costs, availability of plant & equipment & became preferred bidder. More detailed enquiries to the Ground Treatment Contractors to be sought with assessments on adequacy (price & programme) and also reviewed by our Civil Designers. Programmes supplied by the subcontractors to be thoroughly interrogated & assessed before inserting into JMS tender programme, especially if these works are on the project critical path. Total value of Keller’s Final Account amounted to £305,000.00 Regular weekly reviews monitoring of progress against programme were undertaken every Friday throughout the works.. Due to Keller’s originally only mobilising one drilling rig which suffered a few breakdowns in the first couple of weeks JMS encouraged them to bring in a second rig & a drilling team as cover and this greatly assisted in meeting the programmed duration. JMS undertook additional detailed SI to prove ground conditions below the original contract SI as there were no accurate information available to the required depths below shaft formation. All of this detailed SI was passed onto Keller’s along with the Contract GBR Keller’s became to only viable subcontractor due to their availability & competitive offer. Bachy’s offer was excessive & the Geocisa UK whilst being technically robust required nearly 12 weeks mobilisation, plus their offer was also excessive."
"Keller’s planned & originally priced methodology was for ‘Ascending Stage’ grouting but it was proven to not be successful in that their early cored holes failed after inserting packers during the grouting process, causing grout to travelling upwards above & bypassing their injection equipment. This borehole instability caused issues in not being possible to achieve designed grouting pressures into the fissures & also recovering their casings The final methodology that Keller’s adopted was to undertake ‘Descending Stage’ fissure grouting, thus putting a capping treated layer in the upper chalk strata above & concentrating the cementicous grout into the localised fissured areas below the borehole casing and packers. This method resulted in increased drilling back down through the previously fissure grouted chalk and a longer drilling & grouting operation per location."
"JMS employed an Aecom Geotechnical Engineer to advise & adjudicate on Keller’s methodology, interrogate their records, view operations and comment on their eventual claim .Although JMS had no direct opportunity of recovering the cost of employing an Aecom specialist, we utilised this resource to verify and assess Keller’s records plus interrogating & challenging their claims etc. for change in methodology."
"The fissure grouting operation was deemed to be temporary/enabling works in order to achieve reduced & controllable water ingress through known chalk fissures & safe construction of the shaft together with a forward eye & backshunt .The additional works undertaken by Keller’s during their period on site includes: - 63% increase in grout used (i.e. 48.8T). - 56% increase in drilling (i.e. 1,136m), due to 2nd Backshunt, post-treatment test holes, and Tertiary holes. - Grouting of gravel layer (approx. £15k)."
" No issues, their operatives were well trained and adhered to the JMS site rules and procedures."
No major issues other than a few plant breakdowns on Keller’s drilling rigs. Keller’s mobilisation & demob was undertaken extremely efficiently.
This process was adequately managed.
"Tender estimate was woefully inadequate for what would have been required, both in terms of value & duration. JMS were extremely fortunate that UKPN’s PM took a realistic view of complete re-evaluation & re[1]measure, rather than just value the EO on the additional depth of treatment and pro-rata exercise of what was originally proposed."
" Keller’s undertook a 3-day period of proving their borehole ‘Descending Stage’ fissure grouting and only one bore was found to be below anticipated pressures. This was later to found to be a large vertical fissure on the north eastern shaft perimeter. During excavation of the shaft it was found that completed ground treatment was proven adequate to construct the works in wet & dry caisson, together with a change in methodology forced on us by ground conditions (flint bands substantial columnar flints) as we completed the shaft construction by underpinning method. Groundwater was readily managed by localised sump pumping with a 100mm dia high-head submersible pump."
 JMS complimented Keller’s on their working practices and team effort that made their time on site safe for both themselves & our operatives working adjacent undertaking the site set up and often alongside.
Nothing to report on this subject during Keller’s 13 weeks on site.
"As tendered progress was assumed to be 1.2m/shift or 2.4m/day. Advances were dictated by the existing tunnel rings (2*470mm) Cycle time dictated productivity, being 940mm advance per shift. Enlargement element took a total 56 shifts. Enlargement length was increased from 41.5 (tender) up to 54.3m for a permanent design change promoted by JMS site team. This was done to simplify the junction chamber construction from the original ‘Trouser Leg’ to a ‘T’ junction type tunnel connection. Trouser Leg construction was programmed at 11 days although the proposed construction sequence shows 27 stages. Reception spur, design was a circular tunnel at 3.4m with a 300mm thick lining. Programme of 11 days to construct 22m of tunnel. No mention of double shift allowance in the tender handover information. Thorough review of the as-built information by a construction engineer. Utilising the alternate design saved 80m3 of concrete over the original length Review of SCL techniques at preconstruction phase. Site team avoided the potentially onerous construction of the chamber under a main public London highway that had already suffered considerable settlement during the construction of the previous Stage 2 works by another contractor. Thorough review of sequencing and coordination with pre-construction manager & planner. Assuming double-shift this was potentially realistic. To try and meet the programme durations and also avoid wastage of materials (temporary works sealing up the face) double-shift regime was employed. Additional cost incurred providing 24hr noise monitoring as part of the Council’s Section 61 consent agreement."
Testing of SCL. No allowance for cores (£64/per core) 5 cores per 16m3. Survey control. JMS Recently purchased TMS software and instrumentation (no funds). Licence requires updating yearly at a cost of £1000-£1200. Take into account SCL testing requirements in tender. Itemise even. Consider reviewing & revising tender allowances for surveying. Clients are requiring more detail than previous. Surveying allowance not sufficient.
"Tender design for tunnel enlargement was a 3.4m ID 300mm thick SCL tunnel. JMS site team adopted an alternate permanent design that suited the plant and required a thinner lining thus making some savings in material usage. ‘Trouser Leg’ Junction chamber. Tender construction methodology was far too ambitious and of ‘high risk’ with the size of the open face and any realistic attempt to achieve the production rates. Spur tunnel caused a number of issues; • Radius of tunnel far too tight for TBM to traverse upon reception • Plant selection suitable for construction and any form of production would not able to negotiate the tight radius. • Diameter too small to allow the TBM’s stationary shell to traverse through on radius. Redesigned reception chamber. Last minute alteration due to clearance concerns of TBM manoeuvring during recovery. Thorough review of the as-built information by a construction engineer. Note. Alternate profile saved 80m3 of concrete over the original length of tunnel with the added benefit of 150m3 solid material less to remove in the first instance. In addition the profile, although more difficult to set out, was quicker & simpler to excavate. Complete methodology & risk review of large SCL chambers to be undertaken by experienced preconstruction team at tender stage. Plant selection – Shed 1 to be consulted on type of equipment & ultimately its suitability for construction. Better coordination and checking between Shed 1 and site team to ensure sufficient clearances."
Elephants foot – ground investigation to simplify the design. Consider ground investigation. Site team managed to reduce the size of the ‘Elephants Foot’ through a combination of sequencing and ascertaining the actual ground bearing capacity of the clay in the area of the works. The original clients design required a 1.9m wide ‘Elephants foot’ based on a conservative bearing capacity of the clay. Following site tests of the clay’s bearing capacity it was possible to reduce the Elephants foot to 935mm.
"Lack of engineering staff. Short notice of JMS SCL engineer not being released from another project resulted in the need to hire a temporary SCL engineer at an extra cost for the duration, during a period of high demand within London. More accurate coordination."
"Scheaff – • Cable • Age • Kinetic envelope • Investigate purchase Due to the size of the enlargement it was possible to construct the permanent works using bespoke machinery suitable for this type of work. Limited hire opportunities resulted in hiring a Scheaff from Magnor Plant. • The machine had been modified from original removing the cable management system. Trailing cable required constant vigilance as a result. Electric compressor. Cranes. JMS were unable to supply a suitable crane to site due to no availability and weight issues accessing the site. Delivery of heavy plant – load restrictions on local roads Generators, mains power not available until completion of the works.• Due to the age of the Scheaff the control leavers & valves were very worn thus reducing the fine control of the excavation process adding to the over excavation. • Ensure Kinetic envelope of chosen machinery meets the design parameters • If future work is obtained consider purchase. Use of electric compressor over diesel was more efficient when combined with a diesel generator with the added benefit of reduced noise emissions JMS have recently purchased a unit to complement our SCL plant. External hire firm able to supply required crane without the transport issues experienced by JMS Logistics. Discuss requirements with transport at tender stage to identify any access restrictions. Look into external transport as they appear to find solutions when JMS cannot. The use of a changeover switch and two generators to maximise the efficiency. A large 250kVa generator was employed for the tunnelling works and a 40kVa for out of hours for security and drying room facilities."
CPI. Deliver issues due to high demand on Cross Rail and also they have an aging delivery fleet. Investigate other suppliers such as Cemex as an alternative. Additional costs and time would need to be taken into account as extensive trials will need to be carried out for QA & approval by the client.
"Shotcrete Services; • Coordination of materials and labour - cooperation very good. Providing a certain amount of in[1]built protection to contract. Muckaway, no allowance for mixed materials (clay, shotcrete). JMS should look at continuing their current relationship with Shotcrete. Only issue encountered by site was quite a high turnover of mining labour. JMS may wish to possibly employ direct. JMS should look at continuing their current relationship with Shotcrete. Only issue encountered by site was quite a high turnover of mining labour. JMS may wish to possibly employ direct."
Covered under design and method of working.
Test panel – being disturbed & failing to maintain correct environmental conditions that resulted in core failures. Tighter supervision of mining work force.
Cabins – New Eco. New Eco cabins used on site allowed for a smaller generator to be used for weekends.
Double shifting – noises monitoring and reduction measures necessary .When double-shifting there will always be a need for noise monitoring by an independent third party to satisfy the council. JMS do not have the equipment or internal qualified expertise to fulfil this role. No allowance.
Accurate as-built information from Stage 2 of the UKPN project only became available upon request once on site. CDM Coordination was somewhat lacking.
Site layout drawings not to scale Ensure CAD drawing are to scale 2 Fee of 7.6% too small Increase fee 3 Could not use JMS crane due to weight restriction in area Give P&T dept address so they can give us any restrictions 4 Fitter and electrician required on all shifts Noted 5 Foreman fitter and foreman electrician needed on day shifts Noted 6 More allowances for surveying of tunnel and 3rd parties required Noted 7 More grout needed on inside of curve Noted 8 Production rate is tight and need longer to launch shield Noted 9 Control of water was expensive and timeconsuming Noted.
Ladders not allowed on piling rigs Ensure MEWP costed in tender when pricing piling works 2 HAVS detectors used on hand tools which affects price and time to get to site Check with client or read specs 3 Lift supervisor needed on all MEWPs and piling rigs Debateable – suggest that this is a PC role 4 Hardstanding areas – bigger than tender allownace All concrete – no Type 1 due to spragging of wagons and cost of repairs 5 IT installation – costs not enough More expensive than first thought. Allowances to be bigger in future tenders 6 Programme errors Certain links were identified by site team as being not correct. Will review them and make sure that Planner is made aware of them and why.
"Compound/laydown area used to take delivery of new bridge components was not large enough. Early Engagement with Kirow supplier proved crucial in success of planning and delivering scheme. Scheme encountered issues with CRT over canal closure, planning permission and this threatened the scheme. Scheme originally adopted a traditional design/installation methodology without fully understanding land access difficulties around structure. Plot out compound/laydown area in advance and ensure enough room is allowed for compound cranes/bridge components to be stored in advance of the core possession. Ensure Kirow crane supplier is engaged and involved with design and delivery of scheme. Early engagement with CRT essential to smooth delivery of scheme. Fully understand delivery methodology before commencing detailed design."
ATC price submitted based on F001 drawings. NWR unable to place an order with Kirow crane supplier due to internal issues and were forced to request this was carried out by Main Contractor. Ensure process is agreed between both JMS and NWR to deal with and capture change from F001 to AFC drawings. NWR internal governance needs reviewing.
"Trial assembly didn’t exactly mimic the methodology on site. Shear studs on the main beams were retro fitted following trail assembly and this caused issues when trying to fit concrete U deck sections. P-Way verification survey and control re-establishment was carried out by designers surveyors, when P-Way contractor picked up information there were issues between both parties which caused major difficulties. Abutments were propped to ensure their stability and machines could operate closer to the bridge reducing lift radius. Contingency plan worked for compound crane being winded off, Kirow utilized to lift materials from compound. P-Way handback failed to pick up a small number of sleeper pads were missing and TSR signs were not secure. Ensure trial assembly 100% follows expected methodology on site with no variations. Ensure verification work/control survey establishment is done jointly with P-Way contractor. Where feasible prop abutments prior to bridge removal. Ensure robust contingency plan is in place. Ensure handback procedures are followed."
"Programme duration was correct. No Topsoil Import. Farmer retained haul road aggregate for future use. Working ALO for tie ins reduced the amount of possessions. Well managed on site with the correct mix of people. Covid was managed well on site with the addition of a general operative to mange the whole compound area and welfare. Agree negative PMI with the client. Early conversation with the landowners to agree. Engineer / ALO coordinator to check tie ins during PATC stage to consider the amount of possessions. Requesting Agency lads already worked with in the past, familiar with their work ethic. Thermal camera cost agreed with the client early on, worked well. Extra PPE, Extra cleaning regime and personnel covid."
"A few efficiencies on site led to overall stretch target of 29% decreased to 19% with a negative variation back to the client. Plant, materials and resource managed well on site with no overspend . Phase 2 PAF sign off was late with poor communication from the client however this never impeded works on site .Really good stone from the quarry and cheaper than tendered price by £10 a tonne Y .Latter end of works was self-delivered rather than subbed out increasing the savings compared to tender value."
"Great communication on site between engineering team and construction team with regular meeting and site visits .All as built information submitted on time and before programme .Collaborative working between the designers and engineering team to iron out any on site issues in a quick manner .Bell-mouth design over engineered for duration of works, potential to look internally with MAE going forward. Track monitoring permanent station to be considered during PATC stage to ensure no conflict on site Service strike at the beginning of the scheme, late planning permission impeded SI Designers challenged on the MOT detail between the 6G stone and topsoil as not required Time and Cost Saving (Challenge Design early on) Haul road aggregate and embankment aggregate were originally different designer was challenged and an agreed aggregate for both areas was determined this made logistics on site easier to manage Y Site team decreased the site footprint on site this kept the farmers crop to a maximum and descoped the amount of reinstatement required at the end of the scheme. It also added a better relationship between site team and landowners."
SHES Support for ONE SUMMER . Good communication between site team and subcontractor programmes aligned and works completed. Procurement worked well in procuring a good price and quality product from the quarry. Site team visited the quarry beforehand to confirm the quality of the stone.
Compound/laydown area used to store equipment for the blasting and painting works was inadequate for the size of the operation. Due to city centre location after work started on site and in particular the blasting operation additional specialised noise monitoring equipment. Plot out compound/laydown area in advance and ensure enough room is allowed for compound materials/equipment. Prior to starting on site close liaison with the local authority is required and agree a noise monitoring regime.
Schematic design didn’t have enough detail of repairs required due to lack of survey information. Cast Iron stitching detailed on the design drawings was only indicative and not detailed enough. More extensive surveys required at design stage to better inform repair details. Engage with specialist contractor such as Metalock at design/survey stage. Metalock can use different techniques to better understand the condition of the structure thus limiting condition led repairs on site.
Weather Conditions. Access Road Suitability. Quality of plant operatives. Level of Engineering Resource. Approved Design. Design Changes. Attenuation Pond. GPS on plant. Share of information between management on site. Construction use of ITPs. Control of stores. Automated reporting. Material Storage. Handover Information. Client programme unsuitable for type of works. These works should not have been carried out in winter. Stone access roads not suitable for heavy traffic. Geobind road should have been installed at the start of works. Some internal plant ops although competent were not efficient enough for this level of earth works. At the start largely reliant on graduate engineers. Did not have required level of experience. Not fit to start – approved design was not available at start of works. LMJV constantly changing design throughout build process resulting in re works production impacts. Constantly changing design. No formal issue of information – critical information issued by email. All plant to have GPS from the start of works. Not all plant had GPS so reliant on engineers on the ground which was not efficient.
Age of operative vans. Site Wifi. Plant fitter. Health and Safety. Submission of MAFs. Some vans provided do not compliant with HS2 requirements for travel between sites. Site wifi severely inadequate. Despite multiple requests this issue was not resolved by IT. Not fit for purpose – no experience of working on heavy plant. Due to the size / value of the project a more prominent health and safety advisor to take an active role with site operations. Ensure all MAFs are submitted and accepted prior to the use of materials on site – MAF register to be produced and managed for WP80.
"This scheme is ahead of the original programme by 20 weeks. In the month of June we have installed 1717m of 500 & 450mm .PE Due to restrictions imposed on us by the local authority, we had to change the construction sequence and increase the resource. As the this change was to assist the LA with work they wished to carry out, it allowed us to have multiple work fronts and less restrictions on working during bank holidays and events etc. We also designed the scheme to enable Bristol Water to isolate long sections of a strategic trunk main."
"Loose fit slipline PE water pipe in an existing 21” CI main .Pressure testing of the new PE main has been problematic due to the amount of air trapped in the new main. This is due to the poor pressure of supply and not giving the main enough time to swab and settle.  We have worked with the client to achieve a better supply in regards to pressure for swabbing and they are also looking in to purchasing a better grade of swab.  We have also improved the planning/time given to swabbing by the team to ensure the main is ready for testing, prior to mobilising the testing team."
"As build drawings issued and entered on BW GIS system. We are submitting draft as build plans to BW, as soon as each section of water main, (including temporary bypass supplies) is put in to service."
"Excavation Support .Working with MGF for all excavation support design and advice. Due to the depth and ground conditions, this scheme is using trench boxes."
Training and expired tickets. A number of our team’s dumper tickets have or will expire soon. For the short term we have taken on booking training and developing a local training matrix.
We had a issue with transporting small quantities of large PE pipe. LME Bristol & JMS Plant & Transport jointly developed a pipe trailer that could be towed with one of our box vans. This has saved time and money when transporting small amounts of pipe.
"We have had an issue with one of our TM suppliers out of hour’s service. Amberon TM, failed to meet the agreed response time over a weekend. The result of this has been a loss of client confidence. Amberon was immediately removed and replaced with a different TM supplier"
We have had issues in regards to administrating the contract commercially. Variation orders not being signed off by the client. A senior QS is now dedicated to the contract. This is an ongoing issue and has been escalated to senior management internally and with the client.
"PE welding, both butt and EF .The project management team have introduced a robust procedure in regards to carrying out and recording all welding. With our supplier (PSS) we continually are looking to use the most up to date equipment."
"We recently have been experiencing issues with cyclist passing one of our sites and ignoring signage. Together with the LA, our client and a local cycling group we have agreed measures to put in place to keep our workforce and the public safe, but also accommodating cyclists. During the working day we introduce a chicane and signage system, to make cyclist slow down/dismount."
"Programme Overran. Lack of following programme. Programme overran due to limited design information, and unknown risks materializing. Both Client and team did not adhere and follow programme which led to delays at site. Site discussed issues with the gang, and restructured teams."
"Contract team. Procedures. Poor QS performance, which was not initially identified, resulting in change of personnel. Site not set up with LME/JMS procedures which led to confusion. Lack of Central Support to fix."
"Confusion over responsibility for design. Lack of investigation. We inherited a design from the previous contractor which we did not review sufficiently before commencing at site. Should have took stock, and re[1]evaluate design The client and previous contractor had not spent the time and money to complete the design fully and did not carry out any site investigation."
"Designs not followed at site .Site have a good suit of TW designs, but not followed by team, resulting in disciplinary action to address. The site management have really good comprehension of what is required, however took time to transition from Daniel to JMS procedure."
"Quality of Labour. Responsibility of Labour. We used a number of JMS gangs to assist in our works, but had no overall responsibility for their actions, which led to confusion and frustration by both parties. We had struggled to recruit the correct quality of labour locally, and ended up using labour which in hindsight, was expensive and not necessarily fit for purpose."
"Transferring of equipment. Quality and Price. All our works were in congested urban environment and we struggled to efficiently move the equipment to where it was required, in time scales. We relied upon JMS transport from 2 hours away to move equipment when they could fit us in. The internal plant is of reasonable quality ( a bit old, but useable) however the teams have struggled to identify when equipment is off hire, and when its to be collected, and which supplier equipment is coming from, Group do not communicate this effectively."
"Storage of Materials. Within our work environment, we struggled to get materials stored, and removed efficiently, and also struggled with handling the amount of surplus spoil produced."
"Limited availability of reinstatement contractors caused some issues. Limited availability of traffic management companies, we ended up using several different companies."
"Difficult to understand the tender build ups Lack of understanding of our costs spent, systems to control not set up Site too eager to commence the scheme, which led to some inefficiencies and waste Lack of site procedures to record and set up systems."
Some materials free issued to us were defective. NCR’s raised to client and supplier changed.
"Welfare .Working in congested sites, working on busy road, limited availability of welfare locations, and site compounds May have to change methods of work to suit locations."
"Waste Management. Confusion over procedure and responsibility ( no access to smart waste and no training given), difficult to find suppliers who can take spoil and offer re[1]cycled materials."
"Central Support .Lack of central support to the project from Head Office, including setting up of filing systems, quality management systems, environmental plans etc."
"Programme Overran .Programme overran due to limited design information, operational issues and unknown risks materialising. There have been unknown local authority restrictions, causing significant delays. Note – programme overran for every scheme in Amp 5. Ranking:"
"Engineering Controls. Procedures. The way we record site information through as-built during and track sheets and welding records, helped us identify the defective joints. Ranking: Site not set up with LME/JMS procedures which led to confusion. Lack of Central Support to fix. Ranking:"
"Confusion over responsibility for design. Lack of investigation. We inherited a design from the previous contractor which we did not review sufficiently before commencing at site. Should have took stock, and re[1]evaluate design. Ranking:. The client and previous contractor had not spent the time and money to complete the design fully and did not carry out any site investigation. Ranking:"
"Designs followed at site. Site have a good suit of TW designs, created by MGF and installed & followed on site by team. The site management have really good comprehension of what is required. The information and quality of the design brief from Eladio Alvaraz through to Bromborough TW Team has been excellent. Saving resources (time, money etc) by preventing rework on design briefs. Ranking:"
"Resource Numbers (towards the end of the project). Consistency in Site Management. Some of the site team was let go too early (approx. a month too early) to ensure that their employment continued and they had another internal job to go to. Resulting in resource shortages to complete elements of work and causing difficulties and extra strain on the team left on site. Ranking: The site teams have been consistent, however, the site manager has changed 3 times, which has led to communication issues and lack of clear direction to the site team. Ranking:"
"Transport of equipment. Quality and Price. Due to size of machinery and working in a city environment, multiple machine moves was required which was costly and inefficient. Impacting on programming and additional costs. Ranking:"
"Transport of Materials .Issues with transport of excavating material, from site to a compound area, due to the city layout. Possible improvement could be to identify storage areas prior to commencement of works (planning). Ranking:"
"Due to lack of commercial support, to challenge reinstatement and traffic management invoices (i.e. agreed tarmac reinstatement at site level is different from the invoice). Not enough time from receiving the invoice to submitting to the client, to review and justify spends (the project is reimbursed of all costs, however, better use of our site staff and subcontract staff would result in improved efficiency)."
"Defective workmanship .There have been 3 defective joints issued during this scheme (free issue). 1 on an EF coupler – still awaiting from GPS (client supplier). The remaining 2 are in relation to bolts not being completely tightened, due to lack of excavation space. This resulted in costly rework (client’s expense) – however, resulted in costly delays to the programme."
"Welfare Working in congested sites, working on busy roads, limited availability of welfare locations, and site compounds. Potential improvement could be to plan in advance and identify satellite depots, to ease transport to available welfare locations."
Water Management. Issue with disposal of water used for testing – planning for locations for discharge in advance would save resources.
"Central Support. Customer Interface. TMA Compliance (Traffic Management Act). Lack of central support to the project from Head Office, including setting up of filing systems, quality management systems, environmental plans etc. Various complimentary letters of praise have been received from 3rd parties, such as local residents and the client. Particularly relating to the teams conduct on site. Due to good communication and liaison with the local authority, during the difficult and complex scheme, we have received no fixed penalty notices. Resulted from good relationship building between site office and the local authority."
Contract Programme .Employed dedicated planner based on site to liaise with contract team to produce realistic contract programme and update weekly.
"Client unable to fix contract deliverables to allow methods and procedures to be detailed early. Client insisted on early involvement with contractor but didn’t manage the process allowing individuals within their organisation to change the contract deliverables regularly. Making cost plans redundant, and causing uncertainty. Insist on defined contract brief before starting work."
"Design carried out and managed in House. In house manager unable to control deliverables on a fast paced contract creating delay and disruption, suggest external manager in future"
"Temporary works designed and managed in house. In house manager unable to control deliverables on a fast paced contract creating delay and disruption, suggest external manager in future."
"Key staff lacking training to standard required. Labour mostly procured in house. Ensure staff training is maintained annually for all staff. Large numbers of labour required for short term periods causes delay and disruption to Murphy’s structure as a whole, suggest using more sub[1]contractors for short term deployments."
Most plant procured internally. Worked well once systems understood. LME must ensure all procedures dovetail with Murphy’s and ensure staff are trained.
Materials deliveries spread far and wide .Ensure Traffic management plan is in place for all sites early in contract.
Sub-contract negotiation and final placing of contract if different from that envisaged at tender creates huge delays in signing off. LME need to be clear about what is required for sign off and ask for this information up front.
Large scale price agreement and negotiation .Project team involved in bid ensures clarity when bidding.
"Project Deliverables not met. Client’s specification and understanding of proposed deliverables at odds, causing misunderstanding between what is specified and what is actually required. Detailed written scope required from client in sufficient time for contractor to critique and understand prior to work commencing. Require written reports to a specified standard as a deliverable."
Hygiene requirements above the norm .Grass blocks used to provide clean and easily cleaned walkways to reduce dirt carried into office/compound area.
"Diesel spillage from bunded generator/fuel cell .The link between the generator and fuel cell is not generally bunded, this requires separate means of preventing a leak."
"IT poor quality and slow Site has poor internet access with a variety of computer equipment not always compatible. This creates frustration and delay when trying to do simple tasks like open pdf documents, print etc."
Progress reporting. Project progress reporting not occurring on time and to clients perceived timescale.
Permit to work system not being followed by client. Held meeting with client and agreed that he will monitor his permit to work system more closely and that he will provide the necessary resources to produce reports. LME will cease work in future if a permit is not issued.
"Design and manufacturing lead times too tight. Removed work from LME and changed solution to a temporary one, thus removing the need for permanent design."
Contingent workers. HR and management decisions eagerly awaited by site to provide clarity.
Long term storage. A review of the storage facility is under way to identify any further improvements that can be made to safe guard the materials in store.
"Sub-contract set up is in abeyance due to client instruction, sub-contract payments are delayed due to QS/Payment procedures. Agreement of cost budget with client is underway to allow contracts to be placed. QS/management systems have been shaken vigorously by site and contracts management, some sub-contractors have now been paid."
Forecast budget. Under discussion with client.
"Commercial control. After several months of wearing work, this is still not resolved and the site does not have a proper valuation, cost report, variation schedule and payments to suppliers and sub-contractors are delayed."
Production of Management of programme .The initial works were constructed under a very tight program dictated by the client this meant planning was extremely “hand to mouth” ensure that careful planning takes place.
"Site / Office set-up Surveying Setting out. The site security is being provided by the client, however there are problems with induction to the various sites as we have no control over guards changing shift and bringing new staff onto site. The same applies to commissioning which up until now has been done by contractors directly employed by the client but on our sites as we are principle contractor. The initial fitting of the UV rigs was controlled by the client which was not necessarily the best way and in some cases making the hardening (making permanent) difficult. We have been able to utilise the HA Leyland office to run the contract. Ensure the client makes any of their directly employed subcontractors are available for inductions. Ensure the client makes any of their directly employed subcontractors are available for inductions. Ensure the client provides a clear scope and give sufficient time for planning and design."
"Client pushing for earlier delivery of key items. Management of internal designers. Management of subcontract designers (including communication). Designs are constantly being updated as the client responds to the emergency works. Larger items like kiosks have been ordered and the suppliers are working 24/7 to meet target dates. Due to the intensity of the work we have introduced a design manager. We do require some subcontract design for electrical drawings and cover slabs at the moment this is still being finalized. Being managed well, frequent meetings with the client designers are helping to manage changes."
Shoring and temporary works design needed at short notice .The temp works design for shoring has been done by the supplier(MGF) and they have responded well to tight deadlines.
Large numbers of staff and labour required quickly. Keeping Training up to date. Due to the HA Outage being postponed we have been able to utilise existing staff and labour. Ensure staff training is maintained annually for all staff.
Incorrect plant being supplied to site .Ensure correct information is given on requisitions so that specific items are delivered correctly.
Lead Times Requisitioning process. Lack of onsite storage. Smaller items have been no problem and the Requisitioning process is working fine. Due to the HA Outage being postponed we have been able to utilise existing staff and storage at Leyland yard.
Long lead times in setting up sub contract orders . United Utilities are sending contractors to site to carry out emergency work which is not part of our scope. Morgan Marine – The kiosk supplier are producing kiosks and indications are that they should provide a good service. Thompson Electrical have been to site and are currently being set up on the vendor list. Ensure United Utilities inform us of any potential contractors who will be visiting the sites under our control.
"The UV Hardening contract is under the same contract code as the HA Outage which may cause problems splitting costs between the two. Communication (including document control, progress meetings). Ensure documentation is sub coded i.e. MCI0020-1 Set up a separate filing system for UV Works. Due to the urgency of the project frequent meetings are taking place."
Unsuitable plant and materials being delivered to site .Ensure that the correct information is given so when requisitions are produced they have sufficient detail so buyers provide exactly what is required.
Unsuitable plant and materials being delivered to site . Other contractors on site and not inducted Ensure that the correct information is given so when requisitions are produced they have sufficient detail so buyers provide exactly what is required. Ensure the client makes any of their directly employed subcontractors are available for inductions.
Due to the UV works being emergency works the client has provided very little pre contract information which means no surveys have been completed. Carry out desktop surveys of all sites in conjunction with the client and take any remedial actions.
"We suffered from delays to shipping of our specialist equipment. On site, the first 3 months progress was extremely slow. These delays effectively meant we could not complete the project in the good sea condtion period (up to mid November 2012). Trenching Machine TM7: TM7 was modified to be able to work in bi-di mode. However progress was slow with more tonnage required to pull the machine across the seabed, not helped by also encountering some hard/clay areas. Trenching Machine TM7: TM7 was modified to be able to work in bi-di mode. However progress was slow with more tonnage required to pull the machine across the seabed, not helped by also encountering some hard/clay areas. Our JV Partner (Olizki) was either completely ill prepared or unwilling to provide suitable resources – so we lacked labour, foremen, plant and local procurement facilities. The slow site progress meant that the pull was delayed by 6 weeks and this was more of a factor than the General Average. Olizki wanted to control the local resource from their Head Office – this being the way they always do business. Clearly understanding an overseas JV partners business control and ethics is key and more allowance must be considered in future for how business is done overseas. The decision was taken to continue to work through the winter months (for contractual reasons) and the project was completed by June 2013, some 6 months late. We proposed TM7 to the client as an altenative to dredging (and hence being able to offer a saving). TM preparation programme started off as “fast track” driving us down the road of modifying TM7. In the end though the “on site” date was shifted so far to the right that a better suited purpose built machine could have been constructed; subject to the seabed materials being correctly identified. Should seriously consider whether TM7 is a trencher we want to continue to market, or do we design a new trencher altogether?"
"Site / Office set-up. Surveying & Setting out. Onshore pipe string pull down. Moving pipe strings over onto the launch centerline. Testing. Pulling / trenching around a curve and being able to hold the barge on station. Winch anchoring onshore - setting out winches on beach correctly to enable reeving. Trenching Machine TM7 Surveying .Construction method .Trenching Inspections TM7. Trenching Engineer Support barge Tang Seng Pumps. Commissioning and Testing. Hydrographic Suvey. Cabin setup on site took a long time. JV partner took a long time to get started with anything and a better understanding of JV working together would have been beneficial. More indepth analysis of their systems, methods and drivers would have helped at time of tender. Eventually office setup was OK with adequate welfare facilities and fast internet. Good internet connection is essential and made life onsite much easier. Site surveying / setting out was eventually ok as we used UK engineers. It would have been problematic if we had to always rely on the local surveyors turning up. Basic onshore site surveying was undertaken by Project Manager and Site Engineer. Consider taking in-house equipment as staff are competent with its use. Pipe pull down methods took a lot of thought and it required the site team to be in Haifa to appreciate the problems before a suitable method could be finalised. A triple reeved wire pulling system was used with sheave blocks clamped onto the ends of each adjacent pipe string. The 25t capacity De Witte winch could then deliver 75t of pull which was sufficient to move the 700m pipe string forward. The gap between the pipe ends was closed very slow (3:1 ratio), to set the correct gap for welding. No cranes, backhoes or heavy machinery could be used along the 700m long stringing site as the existing underground services and cables could not be moved or damaged. Moving pipe strings had to be done using telehandlers with the pipes resting on greased cross beams and steel saddles. Moving over went better than expected. Many hours of trials were performed to jack up and slide the pipe strings in a smooth and efficient manner. Trial as much as possible before the event – it will save time and money later when everything is on the critical path. Consider sliding over pipe strings on steel beams instead of using concrete beams on certain projects – where concrete is hard to come by or dispose of steel beams are generally more available and have a better resale value. Using UK testing and cleaning company (HTC) was beneficial as the QA was in place and there was confidence from the client that the work was completed correctly."
Design Review. Site /office interface. TM7 bi-di mods. We were taking on a previous contractors unfinished project (pipe strings already constructed and sitting on steel beams). Our usual methods of construction were not suitable and the site team / designers had to tailor solutions to suit. More time should be spent at tender stage with experienced construction staff to review and consider the consequences of picking up other contractors work. Having one point of contact in UK was beneficial to keep control of documentation submittals and getting designs out to site. The link between Bromborough (Geoff Brier) and site (David Reynolds & Mike Armstrong) generally worked well. Communication between site and the office is key to a successful project. The modifications were a compromise to suit the initially limited available build time and were only a partial success. Productivity may have been improved if points raised in above sections were addressed. Side discharge on bi-di legs did not work resulting in lost productivity. On site improvements helped – addition of air lifts (initially prohibited) and addition of discharge extensions - good. Tow forces far higher than predicted To be allowed for in future TM rubs alongside of pipeline Rollers would be better TM7 is a compromise machine desgined as a one off for the Tarragona sealine where a large diameter pipeline was buried flush with seabed in 20-40m water depth using water jetting and air lift. For deeper burial in shallow water a machine that rides on the pipeline would be more sucesfull. If L&M is to continue to offer pipeline trenching services a new machine needs to be developed. Such designs will need to cater for shallow water operation and varying seabed materials (eg. a TM5 type would be better for deeper burial in sands but it is unable to deal with cobbles and harder clays)
Suitability of Temporary Works. The contract required that we take over ownership of a beach cofferdam and there was a lack of confidence as to the reliability of information provided by fabricator (Maagan) regarding the cofferdam which lead to bracing support struts and frames being designed. Implication of design was difficult to communicate to our JV partner as work practices were not the same wrt causeway construction and general excavation methods. So additional safety measures were implemented (though ultimately nothing went wrong). Be aware that when working overseas the verification of information provided can be questionable.
"Staffing, local supervision and labour (experience). L&M experienced staff. We operated this overseas contract on a L&M personnel shoestring. A man down seriously affected our ability to progress without overloading the remaining personnel. But actually bringing out more L&M staff would not have made the project more successful. Not being able to speak or read the language and having no knowledge of where to get items fabricated or procured from, meant we were totally reliant on our JV partner for all day to day items. Need experienced staff on overseas projects. Most internal staff had many years experience in similar projects and were flexible to assist wherever possible. JV partner’s foremen /engineer were lacking in understanding of the work requirements – at ganger level it was fine but the GF could not be left on his own. Dori (Olizki GF) was the supervisor because he could speak English, not necessarily because he was most suitable. Labour resources did improve when Olizki saw the benefits of having gangers and also dedicated van driver to do running about. JV partner Olizki as a company had a lack of understanding of the job and provided little if any specialisation. Olizki’s lacked any sort of management or worker understand (it was like working back in the 1970/80’s in how they treated people). This lack of understanding meant when L&M people needed 4x4s and general site vehicles nothing was provided. Olizki’s understanding of their role in providing labour and supervision was lacking from Day 1, but not sure it was a wholly cultural or work ethic difference. They seemed to focus purely on profit - the profit at tender stage is the final profit. Labour and subcontractors were not paid properly Need to better understand the culture of overseas JV partners and need to ensure that their drivers do not impact on our aims and objectives. Generally the operatives at the end of the job where OK. They had received training, safety awareness, tool box talks and were treated with respect at all time by L&M staff. Whilst still falling short of UK standards there was a huge improvement and a willingness to work for L&M (though not necessarily for Olizki!). Dori’s attitude to the operatives changed as the job went on to be a little bit more respectful. Provide training , lead by example and show respect. Olizki employing Nisim (Local Site Administrator and translator – used to live in Warrington) was an excellent move (better luck than judgement) as the job progressed with his input. Need a good English speaking (and thinking) local man who you can trust to look after your interests. Bringing out Jon Draper to supervise the TM7 build was beneficial as he was onsite directing the local labour and building the TM7, it wouldn’t have been built as well if it only had a UK supervisor directing the works part-time. L&M site team was a good mix of skills who would multi task. Selecting the correct staff to work overseas is key to the success of a project. No issues with the linear winch and barge crew except that in future we will not have sufficient experienced personnel to operate two reel winders, mooring winches and the linear winch. (Having men who can watch a reel going round, but stand in wrong place will be no good and very unsafe) Need more experienced L&M staff particularly if we do more overseas work with bigger capacity linear winches."
"In country plant and equipment hire and material supply. LW Control Cabins. Olizki had a cheapest is best approach, quality of plant (telehandlers), equipment (Chinese crowbars and fittings) and operatives early on (with no training or experience – but cheap) was not great. When Olizki did go with the better options we received excellent service Need to better understand the culture of overseas JV partners. AC needed in control room when working in countries where the sun comes out."
 Management of subcontractors mainly fell under David Reynolds’ remit and was a very difficult task due to the native attitude towards work. It was key to have someone experienced to fill that role.
" Olizkis lack of support did not help us or help the project or our relations with PEI. Chosing the correct JV partner is key. Allowing for longer lead times to discuss logistics would generally have been useful i.e. visa, travel arrangements etc... However it is doubtful whether any differences would have been seen in our JV partners approach. Multiple visits to local fabrication shops were required to ensure nothing was lost in translation."
"Estimate. Administration of the contract. Change Control. Overseas / Shipping. We signed a contract that still included elements that we thought had been removed. This in part was as a result of advise given by our JV partner as to the way things worked in Israel. L&M’s position should always be “words mean what words say” and any contract should accurately reflect what ALL party’s understand at time of signing the contract. Bank accounts and set up of local company took longer than people expected. In effect it took 6 months before we could invoice. At tender stage setting up an overseas company, banking and tax issues should be properly looked at Work Visa system either wasn’t clearly explained or goal posts kept moving as it seemed to take a long time to process and cost a lot of money. More research in logistics of customs clearance, port passes, Working Visa's etc when working overseas is required at tender stage Input from Olizki senior management during site work seemed to consist of trying not to approve payments or do it cheaper or refusing to do what had been agreed. A lot of reliance was placed on Olizki at tender stage to provide quotes. This would be fine if a consortium rather than a JV was to be adopted. More overseas quotes rather than assumptions for high value items should be obtained or more allowance made in L&M’s tender element. Daily and weekly meetings, very proactive for the works (15-30min morning meetings) A handful of notifications submitted, largely weather and shipping delays as well as the seabed ground conditions, notified on time and in accordance with the Contract. There was a lack of knowledge at tender stage with respect to shipping and pricing. We had prices for transport from our yard and shipping to Israel. But there was no allowance for clearing equipment from the port or the storage and transport from the port to the site. A specialist forwarding agent (local shipping line) was employed to provide this service. Often L&M import equipment to other countries under a hire of equipment services or sub-contract and we make it clear to a client that we have shipped only to the port of entry and it is down to them to clear customs and transport to site. On this project we were responsible for ALL customs clearance and ALL transportation from the port. An overseas shipping forwarding agent is a must for any foreign transport when we are the Main Contractor. Materials import / export was difficult on the paperwork side due to our descriptions on the import documents. 95% had the correct desriptions / documents but that missing 5% had an impact on time to clear through customs and cost (custom issues/costs). More clarity required on the descriptions used on the shipping paperwork L&M produce."
" Paperwork / documentation. DNV Verification. Quality and production rate of the local pipe welders was very poor. We used them (at great cost) because of an intitial lack of time to run weld procedures in the UK. If we had known the time scales would be delayed so much, we would have run the procedure and used UK pipe welders instead of local welders. We spent time at the start of the project identifying the key critical items – but more kept adding to the list as our JV partner did not have a clue nor could provide local solutions (that worked). Try and make key decisions as fast as possible. (Unfortunately knowing in advance what will become a key decision is only easy in hindsight). It became evident very quickly that our local JV partner, welding, NDT and coating contractors did not have the skills we were told they had at tender stage. It was also evident early on that any locally employed QA or Document Controller would similarly lack professional skills; that is, big on words but no practical technical or construction knowledge. A full-time proactive quality person was brought from UK to fulfill all quality, documentation and production fabrication requirements. He was also a fully certed Senior Welding Inspector. So although he was not cheap, he fulfilled the role of 4 people. More UK staff would have been required if there were more paperwork demands as the JV partner had no idea about contract documentation and contributed nothing in this respect. We were extremely exposed by Olizki’s lack of knowledge and awareness with respect to paperwork requirements, documentation and certification. Our intitial ideas were to employ a local QA/QC, but it became quickly apparent that local skills were not professional. We were aided by PEI manager’s approach to the documentation as some of the method statements / procedures went in on a just in time basis. If we have responsibilities as a main contract, we should price in our tender for a UK based Quality man – must be multi-descplined. In this case our QA man covered all welding, NDT and coating, all off site fabrications (pulling head/test heads/jack fab etc), liaison with DNV and client QC and production of data packages. DNV were specified in the contract. We managed to keep there costs down (particularly with site visits), though they were still expensive. We developed a good relationship with DNV Aberdeen – this took time but was worthwhile as we were able to limit their involvement to a minimum. The client only wanted a certificate saying “DNV Approved” but other clients may be more aware. Develop a relationship with DNV. DNV should quote for an the exact specification / range of services – this can be expensive (>£100k)."
"General Safety. Safety Officer. Operatives worked to local ways but were open and did use the safety equipment that we provided. Site briefings were translated when we were working on difficult parts of the project JV Safety officer was proactive in his approach. No accidents or incidents. (PEI safety officer was also generally proactive). JV partner had little safety culture and couldn’t see the need, having never worked on an O&G project before. Need to raise JV partners awareness at tender stage (more than just sending them documentation to read – or not read). Our JV partner had no safety culture or awareness except for boots and hard hats. Try and determine whether our JV partner needs guidance and training. (We should have realised from Day 1 as we had to write the Safety Procedure for them and then never received any comments back. Clearly they had no idea what we were on about). The 1st safety officer was useless and not proactive, the 2nd one wasn’t. Keep safety image high, keep training and keep going until you find the correct safety man who can deliver what you need."

Size of site compound restricted by client and no allowance for topsoil area meant very tight compound and storage area .Drilling Fluid breakout Use of nearby head office and plant yard for support. Construct sheet piled cofferdam around worst ground area to contain drilling fluid Procedure for wire-line shorts to be reviewed and ‘tightened up’.
Drilling Fluid breakout .Change of HDD profile design – go deeper to get into better drilling ground The role and responsibilities of the Designer need to be clarified. Where and when possible Engineering department need to de-risk the project – subject to design responsibility.
"Anchorages for pipelines. Needed to be continually monitored to ensure safety, some parted ropes replaced."
Lack of manpower cover for 24 hour working Delays (+ 3months) in issuing contracts of employment ensures that personnel are unsure of their status and affects morale .Company busy with various projects commitments – need to ensure that we retain key personnel by communicating with them. Senior Management/HR to ensure employment contracts are agreed and issued within reasonable timeframe.
"HDD Rig working 24 hours/day – overheating and general wear. Have fitters on site as part of crews, keep engines cool with water and air mover Investment in equipment should be reviewed Frame for the use of power tongs to be reviewed /designed along with additional /ongoing training and or refreshers."
Storage of pipelines delivered by sea from Norway – marker buoy damaged by 3rd party vessel and concerns raised regarding further possible damage to pipes. Pipes relocated to Mostyn - Notice to mariners issued to cover works.
Marine and onshore plant rates for extended hires due to programme delays Originally planned barge became unavailable due to client’s delay to start date Specialist HDD equipment expensive. Negotiated standby rates wherever possible when works suspended Suitable other barge found with cheaper rate Consider purchasing rather than hiring in future – programme delays unknown when decisions made to hire.
"Payment milestones – nothing for pipe purchase, mobilisation or bulk of drilling until punch out. LDs after only 2 weeks delay Insurance issue .Contract priced as a normal HDD project, but the project was in essence a National Grid project which required additional management for paperwork and support. Agree better payment conditions at tender stage."
"Traffic Management – 2 incidents occurred with height restriction (GS6) barriers hit by wagons over the 4.1m limit Limited welfare and office facilities due to limitations in available space on site – criticism from client regarding state of site Safety – no accidents but many hazards on site due to nature of the works and a very demanding client. Need to ensure all drivers and banksmen are aware of the restrictions Due to nature of works and drilling mud it was difficult to keep the site clean at all times Additional works undertaken to ensure site safety – hoses buried, walkways stoned and barriers erected."
"Drilling Fluid breakouts into adjacent farmer’s field and common land Noise issues – site working 24 hours Responsibility for Disposal of Drilling waste solids and fluids. Change of profile, mud and cofferdam Noise barriers erected and monitoring undertaken to appease local residents and council EHO Expensive to dispose of waste – may be better for client to arrange or EA licence to dispose with landowners."
"GA issued a scope document - Request for Engineering for Services (RES) - and we offered GA CTRs of detailed engineering topics for their selection. Carrying out the contract. Clarification of the Scope with the Client. Scope of Work. Documentation. Cost Management. Scope of Work. Ensure we offer what the client has specified and not what we think he requires. The conflict between the RES and the CTRs resulted in wasted engineering. We avoided engineering issues that were important to the client because we had no engineering knowledge of certain topics (see below for details) and also because they were not on the CTRs. L&M must face up to what we do not know, and allow for third party engineering and its management. To ensure that we have some knowledge of such engineering, L&M should invest in placing engineers on courses as part of the contract, if not beforehand. But this is reliant on proper identification of the scope and the deliverables. There should be a system which displays up to date costs by the end of the following month so that trends can be spotted immediately. These were sub-contracted out but the information was probably not what GA really wanted as the requirement was not clearly defined by either GA or L&M. To ensure that we have some knowledge of such engineering, L&M should invest in placing engineers on courses as part of the contract, if not beforehand. But this is reliant on proper identification of the scope and the deliverables. This is specialist engineering and outwith L&M knowledge, therefore sub-contract costs should have been included in the matrix."
Programme. The delays in completing to time included: awaiting feedback from the client.
"Scope of Work. Engineering on the stinger analysis did not commence until we had all data so that we minimised the hire period of the OFFPIPE laybarge programme. This also added to the contact delay, but was somewhat out of L&M control."
Scope of Work. Murphy procurement did not understand or wish to understand that we required to hire the programme. Their intransigence easily added more than 10 weeks to the contract. Just because the supplier is USA based and required up-front payment should be no excuse. L&M operate internationally!
"Delays in management decision making. Delays with Diving Programme. Underestimated weather downtime at planning stage. Delays in the ordering of required works (spud legs), which were required a week prior before they arrive, at the latest. These delays occurred due to internal sign off by management. Unrealistic diving programme developed at tender stage. Suggested action: involvement of operational teams when developing programmes at tender stage. More historical information should have been considered for previous years / previous projects. Additional planning for area – in terms of shallow waters and exposure."
Concrete Collars. Spuds. Concrete collars were fitted quicker than anticipated on the programme – due to good workmanship and positive changes in method of work. The additional of the spuds to the LM Constructor benefited the method of works greatly. The spuds will make a great addition to future works and will be incorporated on future projects.
Design of Collar Fixings. Design of the seabed leveller frame. Diffuser Installation Tolerances. Design fault with guide piles. Diffuser design was defective. Axillary Pipe Frames. The design of the collar fixings made the fixture of the collars to the pipe very easy and effective. The design was completed internally at Bromborough between the estimating and marine department. The design of the seabed leveller in conjunction with the toe head frame were designed within a short timeframe – without the required due care and attention. Issues experienced: didn’t fit properly and caused re[1]work with resulted in unnecessary costs and delays. Internal design issues and can easily be rectified on future projects if planned in advance. Diffuser tolerances were too tight on the design. Internal design issue – better subsea measuring instruments would assist with this in the future. The toe head fouled at installation. To consider in the future – staggered and round piles could prevent a reoccurrence of this issue. New design which was ill fitting and could have potentially caused leakage. The fault was rectified on the Barge (holes filled etc). More thought required on frame installation from design.
"Inexperienced Staff. Plant Staff (back office). In comparison to previous projects (which had long standing and experienced crews) – it was noticed that the crew for this project were not as experienced and knowledgeable. Which resulted in them relying solely on the experienced staff, placing further pressure on them. The recent release of office support in the Plant Dept will potentially cause future issues on projects involving the Barge, mainly the lack of administrative back up."
"Issues with internally sourced (Murphy) .Equipment Issue with Murphy supplied grout pump, which didn’t operate correctly on first use. The issue was rectified on the Barge, which took unnecessary and additional time, effort and resource."
"Identification & Delivery of Materials Late delivery of all materials to the Barge. Including intermittent delivery items of the same order, causing confusion and delays to the project."
"Issues with internally sourced (Murphy) .Equipment Issue with Murphy supplied grout pump, which didn’t operate correctly on first use. The issue was rectified on the Barge, which took unnecessary and additional time, effort and resource. Identification & Delivery of Materials Late delivery of all materials to the Barge. Including intermittent delivery items of the same order, causing confusion and delays to the project. High performance of remaining subcontractors Carmet Marine and Delta Marine subcontractors both proved invaluable. Would highly recommend use on future marine works."
"Supplier Auditing/Inspections .It would have been beneficial to actually carry out some inspections/auditing at supplier premises, during production and prior to ordering materials. This links in to the material section."
No incidents/accidents on site .There were no incidents/accidents during the course of the project – this is something to be proud of considering the high risk and nature of operations undertaken and the environment in which is was carried out.
Sea Squirt. Expand further.
Production of Programme. Management of Programme. Ensure Client has a defined scope of works to reduce the amount of change during tender negotiations. Ensure weekly progress meetings are held with the Client to understand the works interface between all parties on site. Weekly progress meeting did not always take place due to hectic schedules of Client Representative.
"Construction Method. Although our site set up was restricted to a small area on Ditton roundabout, it was fit for purpose and provided segregation from other MCC JV works. MCC JV engineer to ensure he reviews the drawings/information provided prior to setting out on site. This event had an impact on the price and programme, however LME have been reimbursed for the delay and increase in prices for this event. The construction sequence proposed by TW department was very successful on site. The works were completed ahead of programme whilst maintaining the highest standards of health, safety and quality."
Design Change. Design Review. These changes were managed through engineering change notices. Approval of change and cost was gained from Client prior to proceeding with design change. Due to the importance of achieving the sectional completion dates the Client approved the TW design in 14 days rather than the standard 28 days.
TWC. Suitability of Temporary Works. Managed roles and duties of TWC from site on a full time basis. Thurst wall was suitable for jacking against even when applying maximum loadings. This arrangement was also cost effective and saved time on the programme compared to casting a concrete thrust wall.
"Personnel resources assigned to project did not exceed the allowance within the tender bid. Additional training was required for all labour resources assigned to project i.e Confined Space, “Using Excavator like a crane”. This cost was not allowed for within the tender bid."
All external plant hired through Golborne Plant department. All plant delivered and collected from site when requested.
Lead Times. Requisitioning. Majority of the materials required for the project where supplied by the Sub Contractors as part of their package. Sub[1]contractors were provided with sufficient notice to procure materials which resulted in no delays on site. The requisitioning process is efficient as long as the protocol is followed. Potential issues if sufficient notice is not given to the procurement team.
Trenchless Solutions assigned their Senior Operations Manager to the project to oversee the works for the duration of the project. Communication was constant on site. This consisted of both technical and commercial correspondance. SPUK could not re-mobilise to site when required due to commitments with other Clients. LME were not penalised for this as the Client instructed LME to demobilise from site to mitigate costs whilst issues on site were resolved.
Administration of contract Change control. Project Manager and QS ensured commercial correspondence was submitted to the Client as per conditions of Contract.
HSE representatives should carry out at least one site visit per two week period. Senior Management should carry out one site visit per month. No accidents or incidents occurred on site throughout the duration of the project. This was due to a high standard of HSQE throughout.
Keep client informed at project milestones. Perhaps ascertain the time required to produce cost data with the proposals department immediately prior to issuing timescales to client. This will capture up to date information that may not have been available at project tender stage prior to purchase order receipt.
Consider extending the written design brief to incorporate sub-contract design work when not using such well-established designers.
Good practice to be maintained.
The discrepancy was the client’s misinterpretation of the scope. Clearer definition may be required with this client for any future work.
 In future ensure as much as possible that the subcontractor has a developed design that fits the full requirements of the scope of works.
"Basic site set up due to size of onsite team, one welfare unit supplied which was plenty for the works. All off loading completed in accordance with RAMS Site survey carried out by Protech but only in a basic manner, in future Total station should be used to pick up on important dimensions which were incorrectly measured.  All on site construction was overseen by construction manager and on critical dates both PM and Operations manager present.  SHEQ regularly visited site and assisted on lift co[1]ordination requirements when crane lifts required for unloading and placing of process plant items.  Commissioning controlled and carried out by PM & OM with guidance from third party on certain items."
No items with long lead as the small amount of materials we had to use came from the normal suppliers.
"Quite a few design changes, 11 revisions on the P&ID which slowed the project down somewhat, I feel that the design process could have gone a bit quicker if the team had the experience of this type of project.e.g. TWC Permits to Load / Strike Suitability of Temporary Works Hoardings. No scaffolding or excavations were required within the project, access staircase on tanks installed from floor level up wards to remove need for scaffolding. All minor works were able to be carried out with the use of a ladder due to minor tasks with short periods of duration."
The site team were in house employees who carried out a several mechanical tasks whilst the works were ongoing. Electrical works carried out by airside approved contractor who maintain the airport infrastructure.
"Issue with generator from GAP, the item was hardly used but when returned GAP made comment to two items that were missing and broken, the generator was used for a few hours for drilling only and was used that little that the fuel was never topped up."
" Provided a good service but had several missed deadlines on delivery of the tanks, additional order for walkways ended up being very expensive but due to the fixing being required on the tank to house the walkway it was decided to factor out the possible risk should we purchase the walkway elsewhere."
"The big problem that caused such an overrun in the project was the inefficacy of the skid manufacturers who were difficult to deal with as the UK based company used their German office to carry out the design and build process. This became apparent that they were somewhat out of their comfort zone when compiling the design and actually building the two skids. Air Fuel Systems: Assisted the project greatly when required to support the onsite mechanical install, designed and built the additive tank which was .PA Collacott: Provided a good service and reliable when required to attend site, with all the delays caused by other aspects of the work they adapted their programme and didn’t penalise us with additional costs. Barnsley Fabrication Services: Supported the project very well both in offsite fabrication and on site assistance, documentation completed on time"
"The price was always on the tight side with the requirements that Cambridge had asked for and the continued amendments that were chopped and changed from the original work scope. The client wanted a Rolls Royce but only wanted to pay for a Ford,they had incorrectly budgeted for the overall project and the project had stalled for 18 months prior to the project being won. Short fall in accurate pricing of certain items which made achieving the forecasted margin very difficult. The big issue in all terms of this project was the transition between Daniel Contractors and J Murphy and son which caused a considerable delay in renegotiating original orders under the new business and setting up payment accounts and sorting out T&C’s. Accepting that the programme of works would stay the same after J Murphy & Son had purchased the sectors of the business. Consist change by the client project team also caused a delay when technical items needing addressing, Marshall group have agreed that in principal this was not the ideal situation."
" All O&M’s have been complied in an 8 volume suit of files containing over 6000 pages; these have been issued in two hard copies and one CD ROM.  Issues with the skid build were the only quality issues we had, but these were addressed at each step of the build to remove any final issues when the items were delivered to the UK. Electrical junction boxes were swapped out due to too many entry gland so additional funds had to be used to correct this item . Issues with quality were addressed with the Cavotec group on several occasions with very little information ever being up front. This always put the project on the back foot and we were never in a position to be able to get a grip of the German build schedules etc."
Facilities Traffic management plans and all other site plans were accepted by the client and updated when required.  On a secure airfield with no public access and minor vehicle movements .No accidents/incidents occurred within the project.
"Mixed skip used which housed general waste and packaging from deliveries, skip company very good and prompt with the one swap out we had due to the small amount of waste generated on site. Sewage and water refill of the welfare unit was somewhat expensive at £100 per week; surely a local waste management company could be used to reduce the cost of this. We were on site for 20 weeks and the toilet emptying service was +£2k!"
 Weekly Construction Meetings chaired by the Client were constructive to identify progress and or any interfacing issues with other Contractors on site.
"Site Office accommodation was provided by the Client, which resulted in Colleague’s having to double up and sharing offices, site power was often turned off at night causing frequent IT problems the next morning especially in the winter months with damp printing paper and printing devices not working properly."
"Working to the Clients Design, and all site materials free issue. However from time to time they were issues with pre-fabrication Structural Steel not fitting correctly."
"Labour resources were mainly LME employee’s brought back into the business, however specialist trades (Steel Erectors) were resourced from Benchmark Recruitment."
 external Plant with correct certification with minimal break downs.
 All materials orded and delivered in good time for site inspections. Relevant Minimal Waste Skips provided by the client to be utilised on site.
Commercial problems with Cladding Contractor resulted in lost days.
 Consistence approach to all administration aspects. Program reviews at the weekly meeting to capture site progress/delays.
No Non Conformances recorded throughout the Project. ITP Plan all witnessed and passed by the Client.
"Welfare Facilities were adequate, however at times they were reports of stolen items taken from Personnel Lockers, even thought they were looked. Drying Room heating inadequate and Power turned off at night resulting in wet work clothes the following morning. This was highlighted in the Weekly Construction Meetings has a major HSE issue and eventually the Client issued instructions to keep power on to the welfare facilities at all times."
.Waste management responsibility of the client.
"Subcontractors: see Appendix 1 for JMS remarks re excellent behaviour and good site control by Bachy Soletanche. Set up inspection schedule from the start, (see Appendix 2). Bachy to disseminate to the wider site team. Action on next phase of the HSPD project."
See Appendix 3: Lack of experienced Pipeline people a concern. Se Appendix 3 :lack of a dedicated pipeline engineer was/is a problem. See Appendices 2 and 7 Vehicle compliance needs to be included in material price and subcontractor price. See Appendix 8: Murphy procedures/requirements to be agreed in detail with subcontractors at pre start.Work winning teams need to know of shortages. Engineering section need to be aware. Requisitioning and purchasing teams to be educated. Better Subcontractor control.
"See Appendix 3: blocks put on certain subcontractors who have a long association with JMS, delays in approving new subbies. See Appendix 7: ordering and off hire has been very hit and miss, long waiting times, new system needs improving. See Appendix 9: training group procedure needs to be defined to allow user access to records and allow non-line managers to book training for Murphy personnel. Procurement to liaise closer with Project staff. Plant department to be made aware. Success Factor department to be advised."
"M4 Internal Audit progamme is capturing a number of JMS procedures that are not being complied with, continuing with these audits will bring the procedures in to line with the 10 year plan .Collate the NCR’s and Observations raised during the Audits."
Regular monthly progress meetings held with the Client. Client often invited to carry out joint audits/inspections. Cadent project board visits once a month resulting in points awarded / deducted. Good practice to continue with these meetings. Good practice to continue inviting the Client for joint audits/inspections. Keeps all the Project team on their toes.
 I think an espresso session on 212 NCR reporting on what each item means would help promote understanding.
"Extremely time consuming, needs to be set up at the start of a job with the right back ups in place to gather the data. So many comments from HS2 on getting an approved EMP, expect at least a 4 week approval period Compliant waste suppliers are far and few between, engagement with supply chain needed in lots 1 & 3. Control of water on site for wheel washes, jet washes, any pumping, dust suppression needs a proper plan in advance."
"For HP07 specifically when setting up the site, the following should be adopted until the bellmouth and access gates are in place:  The lane closure should be fully fenced with gates at both sides for entry/exit of vehicles.  Vehicles to approach from Harefield side to pull into the site and leave in the same direction  Injunction should be extended to cover that area.  Only put steady men in the area, likely to get a lot of abuse."
"The QS and Project Manager initially allocated to the Project were not contractually strong enough to deal with SMB and many of the replacements employed on a contingent worker basis were little better. This led to unreasonable load being placed on senior BU staff and others in senior positions and adversely affected JMS’s commercial return on the project. There was also is relatively high level of staff turnover on the project in both BU leadership and project delivery positions. The site records maintained were not adequate to enable JMS to demonstrate the impact of the rock encountered during excavation of the trench for installation of the pipeline on the level of productivity achieved or to identify the other factors which influenced the rate of output achieved. This meant that JMS was unable to demonstrate the impact of the rock encountered on the rate of trench excavation achieved and defined cost of the work. The approach taken by JMS to evaluation of change on this project during the early part of the contract period undermined the Customer’s confidence in JMS’s team and prevented any form of trust being developed between Customer and JMS. The issues which arose in relation to administration of the Contract are explored further in Section 2 below. This caused issues with the receipt and issue of customer correspondence when that member of staff was away from the office. We should seek to ensure that :- • We deploy our best people on challenging projects. • We properly check the quality of contingent resources deployed; • Additional resources retained to value major changes or prepare claims on JMS’s behalf are vetted by Contract Services. Note: The changes which have been made to BU leadership in M2 coupled with the businesses policy in relation to contingent workers have already improved the rate of staff turnover within the business. We should seek to ensure that:- • Detailed production records (diaries; labour allocation sheets and daily output records) are maintained on every site which identify the activities undertaken by each operative each day and the factors affecting the outputs achieved; • The lead quantity surveyor on the project is given responsibility for making sure the production team prepare the necessary production records. Consideration should also be given to developing a standard record keeping and productivity monitoring process for all linear jobs delivered within the business to enable us to monitor and manage productivity and to explain and address any variances from the planned rate of output. Seek to ensure that we deal with change control issues in a fair and professional manner such that the information that we present in support or our stated entitlements is clear, credible, realistic and easy to understand. JMS should seek to ensure that when clients provide contract administration systems access is granted to several senior member of the project team and the relevant JMS contracts manager and commercial manager to ensure that:- • Receipt and issue of customer correspondence is possible at all times and such correspondence properly controlled; • BU management can monitor the change control process."
"Tender handover/ project team’s understanding of the conditions of Contact. During the review of the ground investigation (GI) information issued at tender, JMS identified that there was a likelihood that rock would be encountered in excavation of the trench. JMS elected to deal with this by identifying excavation of rock which could not be excavated by a machine bucket an Employer Risk event that would give rise to a Compensation Event. (CE). This is a significant issue which should have been at the forefront of the minds of the project team. Unfortunately it was not, and the issue was not addressed when rock was encountered in the early stages of the project. The most likely happened because :- • the issue was not addressed in the tender handover; and/or; • the project team simply did not take the time to review and understand the contract. JMS’s site team did not issue a NCE in respect of the hard rock encountered during excavation of the pipe trench within the timescale require by clause 61.1 of NEC 3. Failure to issue an NEC within the timescale required by clause 61.1 of the conditions of contract allowed SMB to time bar our Compensation Event (CE) request for the additional rock encountered in excavation of the trench. This prevented JMS from recovering its contractual entitlement in respect of this item. The value of which has been assessed as being in the range of £0.5 to £1m. SMB issued revised drawings for the pipeline post contract which simply increased the depth of the excavation required to install the pipe. JMS issued a CE notification in for this change and later sought to include the following cost in evaluation of the associated CE:- • excavating a deeper, wider trench to install the pipe; and, • dealing with rock foreseen in excavation of the trench. JMS submitted a quotation for this CE in the value of c£1.7m. The quotation, prepared on a prospective basis, included 28 weeks prolongation costs even though JMS planned to deploy additional resources to complete the pipeline within the original planned duration. The approach taken to valuation of this CE by JMS was wrong because:- • JMS sought to include 28 weeks prelims within the valuation of the CE which it would not incur in delivering the change; and, • JMS sought to recover the total additional cost of excavating rock encountered in construction of the pipeline whereas only the cost of excavating the additional rock encountered due to the change in trench invert level was attributable to this CE. SMB was not impressed by this and valued the CE by making a Project Manager’s Assessment of £215K without further recourse to JMS. The approach taken to valuation of this item by JMS damaged the credibility of JMS’s project management team. SMB issued a CE which changed the design of the miscellaneous structures included in the scheme which accounted for approximately 25% of JMS’s contract price. JMS prepared an amended programme incorporating the revised structures and used this as a basis for preparing and submitting a quotation to SMB. The quality of JMS’s quotation was poor in that:- • It did not make any attempt to explain the extent of the scope change which led to a purported six fold increase in value; • JMS’s evaluation of the scope omitted by the change was prepared based on activity schedule allowances rather than the forecast defined cost of the omission. The approach adopted to the valuation of this change led to an acrimonious exchange between the parties and a proposal from SMB to implement the value of the change at 1/3 of JMS’s valuation. This situation was initially retrieved by senior management engagement with SMB which led to JMS being invited to submit a revised quotation for the change rather than proceeding to implement the CE at SMB’s valuation. Implementation of the CE at 1/3 of JMS’s evaluation would have most likely led to dispute resolution proceedings between the parties and caused further damage to the relationship. SMB issued an instruction to JMS which sought to omit construction of the miscellaneous structures from the scope of works. It is understood that this was intended to allow it award those element of the works to another contractor. JMS was advised of this proposal before it was implemented and sought to explain the practical and legal reasons why it would be unwise for SMB to adopt that course of action. SMB failed to heed that advice and proceeded to issue a CE to omit those elements of the works. JMS sought legal advice in relation to the course of action adopted by SMB. In short the legal advice confirmed that:- • SMB was not entitled to omit the ancillary works structures from the contract; and, • In the event that SMB elected to adopt that course of action SMB would be in breach of contract, and that breach could be classed as a fundamental breach of contract which would entitle JMS to consider that the contract had come to an end. In such circumstances SMB would not be entitled to rely upon the provisions of the relevant contract which sought to limit its liability to JMS in the event of termination. This advice was shared with SMB’s MD by the relevant JMS Ops Director. The decision to share that legal advice led SMB to rescind the instruction which had been given omitting construction of the miscellaneous structures from the Works and to engage with JMS on the revised quotations submitted. That engagement led to SMB implementing the CE’s by way of a Project Manager’s Assessment (PMA) at a value approximately 20% less than JMS’s objective internal assessment of the value of the CE. Implementation of this CE at a relatively early stage in construction of the additional works improved JMS’s cash flow and P&L position. Analysis of outputs achieved on completion revealed that the resources expended by JMS in delivering the miscellaneous structures were actually in line with SMB’s assessment. The resources provided by Systech to strengthen JMS’s commercial team at Angelinos and prepare JMS’s revised quotation for the miscellaneous structures were not fit for purpose. This led to JMS having to :- • Divert resources from other projects to supplement the Systech resource: and, • The Systech resources being brought into Kentish Town and micro managed to deliverer the required output for submission to SMB within the agreed timescale. The issue in relation the quality of resources supplied and their performance was addressed with Systech. The S2 business unit was unable to locate an executed version of the Subcontract, and unable to confirm whether or not the Subcontract had been executed by JMS and SMB. The S2 business unit was unable to locate an executed version of the Subcontract, and unable to confirm whether or not the Subcontract had been executed by JMS and SMB. JMS should seek to ensure that : 1. CE requests, and other contractual notifications are issued within the timescale required by the relevant customer contract in order to ensure that our requests for CE’s / additional compensation do not fall at the first hurdle. 2. CE notifications are issued in respect of all change events and that they identify the scope of the CE and the contractual basis upon which a CE is sought. We should seek to ensure that: quotations issued for compensation events:- • Reflect our planned approach to delivery of the works i.e. that they are credible and realistic; • Do not incorrectly include costs incurred in respect of other items which are not related to the CE. Where CE quotations are submitted for cost / programme significant changes JMS should seek to ensure that:- • The extent of the changes to the scope and the implications of those changes is clearly explained so the customer can understand the basis of our evaluation and the reasons for the level of the quotation; • The CE quotations are prepared in accordance with evaluation rules included in the Contract; Where site teams have difficulty in agreeing CE quotations with the customer the issue should be elevated to more senior personnel before relationships deteriorate and unrealistic PMA’s are made and implemented by the Customer. Adopting these measures should help to :- • ensure that reasonable agreements are achieved in a timely manner; and, • help to reduce the risk of dispute. We should make sure all of our commercial teams are aware of the following points :- 1 That unless a contract includes clear words which allow our customer to omit work from the scope of work included in the contract and award it to another contractor our customers are not entitled to do this. 2 Early elevation of contentions issues to senior management can enable the issues to be resolved in a timely manner and improve JMS’s cash and P&L position during the construction phase of a project and help minimise the risk of unnecessary disputes. We should seek to ensure that we properly check the quality of contingent resources and specialist resources retained to value major changes or prepare claims on JMS’s behalf. Contract Services can help with this. Recommend that a procedure be put in place to ensure that:- • We know the signature status of all customer contracts; and; • all original executed contracts are held by either Group Legal or the relevant business unit commercial lead."
The IT connection to the site office was not of a sufficient quality to enable the Site team to upload documents to the F: Drive. Ensure that IT connections provided to sites are fit for purpose.
Client doesn’t allow time to be Fit to Start Original 6 week programme was keen – spoilt by client delays (material late and concrete pipe) Design adversely affected efficiency Look ahead programme needs to be done Planner and PM to take ownership of programme Programme needs updating weekly Programme needs accepting and base lining
"Scope of works needs to be defined A review of records needs undertaking before hydro test Control of QA documentation Management between workshop and office Visibility of works and programme Input into programme and sequence ITP for Leeds, needs signing by Leeds so buy in. Use of Power BI good MPI spray to be cleaned before sending pipes."
"Site Layout. Unable to excavate 12” and 6” trenches at same time due to restricted working room The access points arranged by client dictated the method of working – wasn’t picked up at tender Amount of as dug stockpiled was under estimated and in relation to working areas, this caused some disruption."
Fabrication drawings were slow to be produced Fab drawings didn’t factor in actual pipe lengths – lots of green length left which involved site cutting Doc Control not used Data Dossier not produced until completion.
"Batter on excavations – trench too wide, not enough room to store as dug Trench width – too much sand cement used."
Pipe fitter missing from team – CM did this role so not supervising Pipe fitter to prep pipes above ground to speed up installation.
Diesel road tow weldsets – use invertors and generators Clamp and cutter hire – we must have these in the business without going external Excavator attachments – compactor plate – is this cost effective?
"Trench was wide in areas – more fill used Wrong tape wrap specification ordered – delays with supplier changing over to correct materials Amount of wrap removed from pipes at Leeds – could be reduced Issues with supplier deliveries – almost ran out of fuel, wrong power brushes delivered Free Issue Materials – Not all available on day one, pipes had to be cut to suit design – design not reflecting the pipes available Transit notes for materials between Leeds and site not used, no record of deliveries No inspection and cleanliness carried out on pipes arriving from Leeds Rubber pad materials – procurement did not ring around and get competitive quotes – we paid 3 x what we should have – Bolts, being bought from 1 supplier because its easier – should shop around to get better quotes."
"Linac Xray house – Overloaded which caused some delays Linac- defects not recorded on approval sheets Iris – performed well – Proactive Iris – site xray – allowed 10 hour shift, complete in 4 hours, can we get them to do more per shift Supervision for night time xray – need to have JMS management available Vacuum Excavation – Went well, but had to book 2 day slot – works complete in 1 day . PTS -Bolting of flanges – Not agreed before hand who’s scope it was PTS guys appeared at 8am day before night shift for induction etc – This could be done at 12 noon on same day – we are charged 2 days as they have no work on. PTS – A list of all equipment to be produced – needs to detail how many flanges, hoses etc Test Consult – Work undertaken well, however needed constant chasing for RAMS – eventually issued the day before."
Changes to design in Leeds not fully documented and followed through Changes not advised to site Client not administering contract Client not acknowledging programme and EWN/CE’s Client not agreeing CE’s Site making Commercial aware of changes on time.
Holiday of pipes before lower and lay – not just weld areas Ownership of site QA – not just fab shop Bar chart held at Leeds – Needs site input Photographic records – 10 per day to show progress etc.
"Site layout not ideal for works Due to lack of notice to start, relied upon speedy hire for comms Welfare unit self contained – works on small sites No feedback cards on site – no cards issued in 10 weeks No near miss reports issued No accidents – positive culture."
Water disposal points needs agreeing WAC tests for spoil to be removed Storage and stockpile of materials.
"18% minimum margin achieved Work undertaken with fewer resources than allowed in the tender. Overspend on some materials – Sand/Cement, pipe wrap material."
"Landside Site facilities – no space to work efficiently, sharing client welfare, insufficient parking availability Landside Logistics controller required, Working Room – Not enough room. Work Areas. Airside Facilities. Minimum 2 Escorts – not enough. Airside facilities not capable of dealing with accelerated programme. Internal discussions between project team. Use of mobile phones on site. Landside cabins poor wifi. Not enough airside drivers. AirDAT and GSAT training hindering managers meeting. Designated Yard with enough room to receive deliveries, initial briefings parking and laydown area Abandoned farm land off Runger lane could be utilised as a long term set up The dedicated person will be included in all plant / materials requisitions and brief to the escorts daily as to the movements of the day and plan the allocation of timings and movements, this person will also be responsible for delivering JMS Inductions and taking copies of all training tickets, it would be ideal if this role also had a yard man that he controlled and both were blue passed so they could obtain airport Passes for anyone attending site, they would also control the recording of pass numbers and vehicle passes to ensure none go missing or are not returned as dated. Define working areas at beginning of contract/tender and do not reduce until complete Also request additional airside holding areas for vehicles / plant / stone stores. Need to look at CDM area and working areas on site – Need to segregate spoil and stone store areas, material laydown areas, segregated plant and labour routes, designated safe areas for mobile phone use. Need to allow for double stacking, pedestrian barriers, and dark room facilities. Drying room needs to include for increased resources ie welders, mech team, subcontractors and general workforce. 2 escorts minimum for normal times, More escorts required in order to keep smooth operations when muck away etc Subcontract this as it frees valuable labour for site Disagree with this, I believe we had enough escorts but didn’t manage them correctly between the contracts, a Logistics coordinator would plan daily activities and all requests for an escort to go via the coordinator, GPS tracking would also be an advantage. This would assist with escorts needlessly going Land side and having to join the entry queues. Ensure that if acceleration required, cognance of site facilities reviewed. Open plan offices to allow intercommunications and personnel to discuss situations and way forward. Intrinsically safe radios and use of permitted band width to improve communications – only use in safe areas. Wifi connections to be reviewed prior to installation for best connectivity. Driver training to be reviewed and as many people as possible to allow greater flexibility on site Driver policy to be produced. Dedicated laptop/desktop to allow personnel to undertake training without hindering management works."
"Perimeter fencing and lights. Emergency Response Plan – not overly converse with. ADM Meeting – impact on setting men to work. Insufficient time to handover work faces. Plant Hire wanting to swap externally hired vehicles for internal. QA/QA/QC (SWS) Support . ITPs – incorrect understanding. Document Control – Not used correctly. Incorrect allocation sheet being used. Technical Queries – present issue and solution. No understanding of client specifications. SHESQ support to be more prominent on site. Correct plant being utilised – tracked excavator vs rubber duck. Time consuming transporting items with rubber duck. If TIG welding is used for cleanliness then additional working space. Inefficient dewatering techniques – 2” sub pumps only used. Formation checks. Incorrect protection to excavations – pedestrian barriers. Incorrect ladder sizes on temporary works. Limited no. of gas monitors. Lack of control of materials and plant. Valve Chambers and MIPS design. Not enough end caps and locking stoppers and not always in place. Level checking – not enough time and designs not accounting for level differences (slopes). Installing Hydrant Pot under pit valves and low points prior to being concreted. Pot installation. Better resource planning and co-ordination with radiograph company. Night Shift Co-ordination. Hiring consumable plant items – grinders, 110v leads. Critical Sub-Contracts. Central support. Specialist services. Bulk deliveries. Muck Away. Survey works. Plant and Materials. Need to include for red/white fencing and red lights with dedicated generator and fuel tank. Practice co-ordinate with MAG on dummy emergency situations to ensure everyone is aware Could be carried out by the safety department in addition to a safety audit, we requested this but it never happened. Management to attend ADM meeting to allow WS to co[1]ordinate works Delegated person to step in if WS away or attending ADM Disagree with this ADM is just a mechanism for the airport to know what is planned on movements and anything that would happen outside our CDM area, they are not interested above movement numbers, JMS should have its own actual SIMOPS / coordination meeting the previous evening to coordinate movements, plant, labour and planned works. a nominated person who holds a blue badge can attend feeding back the information from the internal meetings, this will free up coordination specific staff / supervision. Correctly programme handover and time to survey and check areas before other contractors take ownership. Due to the process of MAG security this needs to be reviewed on the project carefully with timescales and agreed if possible. Identified early in project QA/QA/QC (SWS) to secondary checks on all elements. Embed from Day on on Organogram so responsibility. SWS consultancted on level of attendance required and build into bid Adhere to ITPs All activity should be controlled by ITP with workpacks introduced to control activity ITPs to be written & reviewed by subject experts e.g Welding – Sws Checksheets need to be implemented and be part of the verifying documents for all activity (Civil/mechanical and Electrical). Adhere to ITPs, these must be approved by client ITP knowledge to be increased through training. Use Aconex as a tool to ensure clear transparency between project planner and client Ensure proper time to plan Agree with client early on sign off of work packages as per phase so all review is not conducted at the end. Suitably steer client to sign of work packages MDR to be reviewed weekly by project team, DCC shall be owner of this document and issue numbering and return dates for procedures/MST etc. Correct allocation sheet to be used with updated plant from Syrinx Roles and responsibilities on who is to complete these and who is to review them would assist on this. Put onus back on client to provide solution, hold risk reduction meetings if required to discuss jointly. Engineers to read and understand as much as possible regarding specifications and designated experts allow to help. Work a workshop with relevant technical experts such as SWS aid in this so all parties are clear of responsibilities. SHE support to be more involved in activities to support site team with correct documentation and joint inspections with the client. The same applies to Quality and Environmental, the audit schedules need to be adhered to and identified on programme. Rubber ducks to be used for transporting material and backfill Tracked for excavation works as have ability span excavated area and greater stability. Small telehandler to be used efficiently for unloading. Welding shelters have to be used for TiG due to process this will need to be considered at tender stage due to additional space and requirements. Also add time for additional preparation/cleaning. Include for silt buster on all contracts moving forward and 3” / 4”pump incl. permitry supplied by client and discharge point. Correct techniques to be used incl. blinding then to be used Kerbs to be laid straight on to concrete for bearing pressure. Use edge safe barriers or increase length of sheet piles by additional 1m to use a fall protection. Range of ladder sizes. All personnel to have a gas monitor and issue a gas monitor to each person. Dedicated storeman to fully control all aspects of materials and plant Material control procedure to be followed, stock control sheets etc. Involve SWS on permanent piping materials This includes one landside and airside. Need to re-design the chambers to incorporate davit arm Run off from chamber lid Concrete chambers quicker and easier to construct than fiberglass. Need more locking stoppers and end caps to ensure cleanliness is kept up. Mechanical crew to be solely responsible for this element. Plan as-built survey for collection of data. Review all pot data with spirit level and sign off MASHCo. Ensure concrete is placed and cured prior to removing transit bars and installing low point Potential innovation idea to create internal support mechanism. Due to potential movement of pipe during backfill, and issues with handling delicate pots, hydrant pots to be welded on after pipe backfilled. Set nights for radiographing Following day QA/QA/QC (SWS) verification of welds. Utilise night shifts correctly and fully Resource with supervisor and management cover Hand back of night shift to day shift needs a coordination meeting, or a format of communication back to the day shift. Purchase consumables such as grinders and 110v leads as these are charged out at a weekly hire rate and when written off and charged full price for them. Critical sub-contracts to be asked to include in price attending site the day before to carry out inductions and pass paperwork, a lot of one day activities turned into 2 day activities due to the unknown waiting times and availability of the blue badge holders to complete the paperwork and obtain passes. Agreed days for site visits and audits / inspections from the SHESQ department including environmental, QA & Planning, and length of visits eg a day’s visit should be a day on site looking at that contract not a day on site with traveling or completing paperwork for other contracts. Agreed days for site visits and audits / inspections from the SHESQ department including environmental, QA & Planning, and length of visits eg a day’s visit should be a day on site looking at that contract not a day on site with traveling or completing paperwork for other contracts. One dedicated person dealing with the coordination of the specialist services department, controlling labour requirements, plant, equipment, inspection, NDT, coating. Use the function of SWS as laid in the JMS business plan. Coordination to utilise off peak hours access to plan the majority of our bulk movements, eg muck away, stone delivery, plant delivery. If this was delivered off peak then it would be easier to have it on site and would free up daytime staff for normal activity works. Utilise a local area (landside) to stockpile muck away (transfer area) this would massively increase turnaround time on muck away wagons. Include for an attendance on site at the start of the contract to set all required TBM’s (temporary Bench Marks). Central store Airside with a controller that keeps all small & Large plant so this doesn’t mean double hiring of equipment that isn’t used daily. (This person could also stand down plant when not required). All delivered plant could also be checked in for condition and photos taken, including confirming all the items are returned."
"Ground Conditions. Services and Uncharted services. Live or abandoned services. Temporary works needs to be decided upon early. Engage with TW provider. TW design. Original plan to excavate with excavator changed to Vac Ex dramatically increased timescales. Temporary Works – Correct Temp Works design in place prior to works, allowable variations in design. Ground conditions – unclear and poor information provided by client. Ground Conditions. Tipping. Do we have accurate ground info before commencing – need to programme for trail holes and development of TW designs. Need to look to undertake CBR tests at formation levels, to confirm bearing capacity of ground. Need to obtain accurate utility info and organise for GPRS. No one in MAG would confirm whether services were live or dead – MAG need to be more proactive. Delays due to uncertainty of which TW method to be used – boxes or sheets – When decided boxes were not suitable, the VAC exc wasn’t deep enough s unable to toe sheets in, resulting in concrete base. TW supplier to be invited to site to assess the works and methods required. Does the design need to include for 12mtr opening at all stages – this increased jacks to 60T, Could we use 8m or 10m to reduce strut size. Do we need to use concrete at bottom of trench and temp strut – is it cheaper to use multiple struts and feed pipes through. Braces need to be 6m long each, and capable of connection, as this allows for the trench to be excavated without long reach. Need to look at trench width, design based on welder and xray access widths, not standard bucket size – lots of waste of muck away, CBS and MOT backfill. Design width needs to suit works, not how much concrete has been broken out. Identify correct excavation techniques prior to mobilization. Challenge Temporary works companies for smallest lightest designs not what is lying in yard Allow variable designs/alterations to cope with changing site conditions. Either clarify out entirely at tender stage that ground conditions are not part of works Sufficient time to undertake proper ground analysis. Need to review ground info, with regard to Water ingress. If water is encountered, and the as dug spoil is wet, it will need to be disposed of at another tip location and incur additional £180 per load charges. Previous allowance of 1 hour per load waiting time was insufficient, especially for stand 57/58. Going forward, each load needs to be either 3-4 hours waiting."

Older plant having faults and issues required multiple fitter visits and resulted in loss of production. All plant should be under 5 years old. Carry out PIM (Pre Inspection Meeting) with subcontractors to ensure understanding of processes and procedures and to ensure all documentation is approved prior to works commencing. Ensure the additional requirements for contract in the sub-contract PO are acknowledge by supplier, and these are returned prior to start of NDE activities. Ensure that document control are involved with ensuring key document are formally transmitted to client and sub-contractors.

"Site Resource. Allocation sheets – Link to programme activities. Site Costs. Weekly Site Cost Reviews. Programme update. Verbal instruction not being followed up with CVI or email. Acceleration requests. Early Warnings. CE’s. At the point of acceleration and multiple areas of work instructed by the client to be undertaken concurrently, commercial should have ramped up to deliver the works. A dedicated site QS would have had a greater degree of commercial control and aided recovery of value. Full time commercial support would have been better to liaise both with the site management to ensure the allocation sheets support the CE's & planning to ensure the programmes support the CE's also. Allocation sheet activities to be linked to programme for more robust sheets for claims. Management team to review plant and labour allocation and act upon in timely manner – Not keep hold of plant “in-case”. Weekly review of site costs, planned v actual. Site programme to be updated weekly, with any delays identified, with mitigation measures discussed if required. Management to ensure recording of CVIs and noted on allocation sheets. Acceleration requests not to be actioned until formal instruction and cost recovery mechanism agreed. EW’s to be issued timely and registers kept up to date. Weekly review of EW’s with meetings to determine whether lapsed or moved to a CE. SWS to raise Early warnings formally and in due time. CE’s to be priced as soon as practicable, with programme back up to demonstrate cause and effect."
"Weld Procedures. Delivery and Cleanliness. Pipe End Caps. Programme. Welder / resource Continuity. Fabrication ITP and Procedures. Current Cellulosic procedures create a lot of fumes and require lots of post weld clean up. Need to look at cleaner procedures. Discussed and actioned. The pipes need to be transmitted to site correctly and check sheets need to be signed and not just ticked. The pipes need to be inspected and recorded on the transmittals. We received a couple of deliveries where end caps had “blown off”. Caps need to be secured using suitable “gaffa” tape prior to dispatch. SWS to ensure checks. Fab programme needs breaking down further and measured by site team. The site programme also needs to be shared between site and SWS. Projects cant be priced using resources to dip in and out from Sws. Core team of welders and Inspectors need to be priced during site works, and if necessary retainers to be used. Sws to only provide adhoc resource where site struggling. Need visibility of fabrication procedures, produce flow charts for who does what, where its stored, what is produced etc. ITP’s and RAMS to be produced in Sws and adopted by site."

"Early Engagement. Scope of Works. Water / cleanliness testing. Hours. Supervision. Equipment. Cleaning. Documentation / RAMS. Test Procedures. Need to include PTS in project early doors and agree testing programme, night/weekend working and exact scope of works. Need to test water used for testing and cleaning, and also test the water post test to prove there are no contaminates in the water. PTS need to appreciate requirement for 24 hour works, and ensure that the team are rested for night works. Need to look at how to get PTS people back and forth on the airport. PTS supervisors need to understand “one Murphy” and act with the team to deliver the works, not but barriers in place and be obstructive. Camera units need to be crawler type not push rod as CCTV recording isn’t good. Jetting unit, needs to be centrally in pipe and not on bottom. Need to look to see whether pressure jetting is correct or whether we need to look at pick lining the pipe or steam cleaning. Needs to be relevant for the project and FFP, previous RAMS were updates from other projects. Need to have specific procedures for testing, not rely upon RAMS."

All relevant standards to be issued to procurement and procurement to arrange for 3 quotes for all materials. All order requisitions to be saved on server and signed by PM for accountability. Status of orders to be checked weekly. Procurement to ensure that materials ordered align to clients specifications. Any quality issues or shortages to be advised to procurement asap. Use SWS vendor and experts where practical. Identify suppliers and hold meeting to discuss possibility. Details of arrival and leaving time for muck away and other delivery wagons to be logged by storeman. Look to use timelapse camera if needed – Lots of bills received for waiting time. Costs received for wet spoil, which is significant increase. Look to identify free tip sites."
"Sub Contract Passes. Pre-Start Meeting. Sub-contractor approval. All subcontractors to be identified early and enlisted on airport security pass system (min 2 months). They must also have their own driver availability. This applies to : IRIS / NDT, Sweeper hire, VAC EXC, muck away? Hiab Wagon. Pre-start meeting to be arranged with all subcontractors. All relevant standards to be issued. List of deliverables and attendances to be agreed prior to award. JMS to formally notify Mashco of use of sub-contractor and approval gained in writing."
Engagement. Engage with support function at outset and agree SLA and support requirements.
"Tender Schedule not suitable for construction and not representative of the works. The schedule really required completely overhauling from contract award when the client issued completely different drawings from those used to tender, this was stopped by the business as not in line with planning procedures. Schedule for construction was therefore a version of the tender with new and revised works added in to the existing schedule, since drawings where issued throughout the contract period we never had a complete schedule with risk, float etc clearly identified and could never therefore match the schedule completely and accurately requiring constant updates, resulting in constant client complaints about meeting dates etc. Client also added in constraints on day one which weren’t in the tender and therefore we should have re[1]scheduled the contract from scratch to give site a chance of having a workable schedule, and identify time issues from the start."
" All as per client who acted as principal contractor. We were moved to 3 separate offices during the contract causing disruption. Surveying and setting out by JMS engineers who arrived able to use an instrument but otherwise untrained in setting out structures, training was on the job managed by the site team with no help from the engineering dept. Setting out has therefore been expensive, but given the complexity very successful. Testing and QA as described by the client and on a basic level, mainly through pre, and post pour inspections. QA plan too complicated and useless in the main. No feedback from QA dept and only one visit during job."
" TW mainly for dig and a few shutters, RMD and MGF produced designs TW checked and approved no issues. Meeting with TWD before work commenced smoothed the way."
"Labour sourcing is a very hit and miss affair, people are ad hoc given to site then removed at short notice without site having any power to retain them in critical situations. LOSC was used to boost numbers but JMS continually interfered with this meaning we didn’t have stable site team for long. JMS people’s competence is many circumstances is questionable, too many hangers on. Those JMS who are competent are in short supply and over used. Each man comes with a separate van and lodge and travel making them very expensive. Typically a LOSC joiner cost £22/hour, a JMS joiner cost £36 and the LOSC ones where in the main equal or better quality"
"Plant systems are not matching 365 resulting in more paperwork, site requisitions a piece of plant, PSC puts onto 365, quote goes to PSC and random person for approval, order comes to site then for approval. Often this is rejected as it doesn’t match requisition. Meanwhile plant arrives, without certification, without all the required add-ons (chelywn valves, spark arrestors, buckets even for instance). Plant argue they’re not needed, site insist it’s a contract requirement, plant refuse to deliver without site of contract. Plant costs aren’t always clear, syrinx doesn’t match 365. Not sure what value PSC adds it’s just another level of overhead producing no discernible benefit."
"No major issues with lead times, however everything purchased on P-card due to 365 issues."
"MGE poor site management and unorganized, lack of timely RAMS and personnel changed last minute. In general sub-contracts for small works used, lead times to procure is several weeks which can cause issues when changes occur, problem seems to be in what value a PM is allowed to approve (£1000) i.e. too low not any use whatsoever in gaining approvals."
" Tender price didn’t match tender drawings, tender contract not understood in pricing, price not matched against CESSM. Client administration and change control procedures not understood. JMS schedule not matched to price, or BOQ. Progress meetings weekly but not matched with change, measure. QS’s not available for first 6 weeks of contract, measure value still not understood (2 weeks before end of contract). Claims and variations poorly managed by QS’s who lack basic understanding of how to manage a claim. PM and CM spending large amount of time trying to bring claims back to something realistic."
MGE had several ncr’s against their piling installation and testing. One minor spalling on a concrete wall. All resolved without issue.
" Facilities. Essar is main contractor, have only basic idea of site safety. JMS full time safety supervisor and experienced staff have kept incidents to a minimum. LOSC appreciated JMS CDP and being fully included."
"Lack of client planning on enabling works. Short notice change of Client priorities due to recent world oil price fluctuations. Due to the necessity to maintain an “operational” site during the refurbishment works, many delays have been encountered because little pre-start planning by the Client was undertaken to ensure operational continuity. Thus client often requires “urgent” temporary works resulting in delay to project works and additional cost to the client. This continues to be an issue although some improvement in planning is evident. We continue to assist in planning. This has resulted in changes to fuel type allocation to tanks resulting client requests for changes to already installed new pipework. Whilst this represents additional works for ourselves it hinders completion of the project. We can only attempt to work in accordance with Client requirements. Some +ve, some –ve."
Site offices inadequate. Material storage space inadequate. Current office space was allocated by PC / Client. In future we need to be more forceful at tender stage to demand adequate offices No change on this one as no space available No change. Ditto No change.
Design Technical queries Response from client very slow creating the need to issue EWNs to client causing much additional admin work. Continue to advise the client of the importance of responding to correspondence in a timely manner. Much improved now that client has changed his project manager.
"Design of enabling works by client was never thought through properly resulting in constant “urgent” temporary works. In future, ensure the client / PC is aware of the requirements and ensure they plan accordingly assisting as necessary."
Extremely competent fitters / operatives on site. Important to maintain skills on site to overcome client problems.
"Regular inspections / maintenance carried out on site of all plant, particularly hired in plant. Avoids costly claims from the plant hirer when plant is off-hired and ensures minimal down time."
Materials stored in various locations on site. This was forced on us by the client due to inadequate storage facilities available. Difficult to manage deliveries and stores issue and security. This continues to be a problem and will not be resolved as no space available No change.
"Procurement of subcontractors. Use of local Subcontractors. Subcontract prices / rates, and actual subcontracts agreed well in advance and thus subcontract works flow smoothly. Use of local subcontractors in Cornwall has resulted in lower costs (rates are somewhat lower in this area) and improved service."
"Lack of response from client in respect of EWNs, TQs etc. Client ignorant of Contract Conditions/requirements. Causes delay and frustration. We try to educate the client on these matters Client has now changed his project management team and correspondence response has improved. Project difficult to manage as correspondence to client is often left unanswered, including EWNs and PTQs. This has now improved due to above EWNs are still not being answered / acknowledged as required by the Contract Conditions. However we are being paid for the additional works with few queries so bad in one way, but okay that we get paid."
"Main pipework fabricated and painted off site (Fab and paint shop) Client design errors LME / Client relations Security good on site. Better quality control and finish Due to many Client design errors, many alterations to pipework have had to be made on site following which painting has to be made good. Quality of site painting / finish is acceptable but not as good as shop finish. Despite the many difficulties on site (storage, client design, Offices etc) LME continue to maintain good relations with the client who is pleased with our performance and manner in which we can “solve” his problems Despite the fact that material and plant is stored in many and various locations,on and off site where it is not practical to securely fence the areas, security has not been an issue as police man the main entrance to the dock area and make regular patrols."
Operational site – working alongside client operations staff. Client staff working alongside L&M staff. Client staff not accustomed to the rigorous H&S requirements of our operatives. Not mandatory for client staff to wear safety specs. Many hazards on site such as temporary hoses running around site. Therefore greater vigilance required by ourselves. Contractor SHE “culture” has improved performance of Client operatives. Good H&S culture of L&M staff “rubbing off” onto client staff thus improving their culture. Continued improvement evident.
Old operational site. Site refurbishment. Site has been operating for some 60+ years and thus much ground contamination with hydrocarbons etc. Due to this project much of the site will be cleaned up.
"Site location. L&M not PC on this project. Site is located within the Falmouth docks adjacent to other operational companies and there has been inadequate liaison between the client and other companies, particularly with regard to SHE matters. Since L&M are not PC on this project we have little control on day to day SHE matters. We should carefully consider taking on projects where we would not be PC."
"Lack of client planning on enabling works. Due to the necessity to maintain an “operational” site during the refurbishment works, many delays have been encountered because little pre-start planning by the Client was undertaken to ensure operational continuity. Thus client often requires “urgent” temporary works resulting in delay to project works and additional cost to the client. This continues to be an issue although some improvement in planning is evident. We continue to assist in planning."
Site offices inadequate. Material storage space inadequate. Current office space was allocated by PC / Client. In future we need to be more forceful at tender stage to demand adequate offices No change on this one as no space available. Ditto No change.
Design Technical queries .Response from client very slow creating the need to issue EWNs to client causing much additional admin work. Continue to advise the client of the importance of responding to correspondence in a timely manner. Much improved now that client has changed his project manager.
"Design of enabling works by client was never thought through properly resulting in constant “urgent” temporary works. In future, ensure the client / PC is aware of the requirements and ensure they plan accordingly assisting as necessary."

"Late or non Pemitry. Individual Task Permitry. Tankers. Programme amendment. We have encountered late or non permitry due to various reasons such as meetings, new Permit Issuers not familiar with proposed scope & Permit Issuers not agreeing to previously approved methods. Re-occurrence will not be preventable until Permit Issuers are involved in approving the submitted methods (RAMS) before Site Starts. From previous report dated 25/9/13, permitry drastically improved and no longer became an issue therefore not impacting programme. On arrival it was suggested that Permits were only going to be issued daily and would cover only a single job step e.g burning plates then removing them would be split into two separate permits. Only one permit issued so we have to close one off before obtaining the next one resulting in delays. We have had to stand guys down even though we have had external works to carry on with because works were being carried out within the tank. This policy was unknown until our arrival. From previous report dated 25/9/13, the client agreed that we required multiple aspects on the same permit and implemented this accordingly. Permit suspensions due to incoming tankers loading/unloading condensate in the Tank vicinity. Client to accept and pay for delays. From previous report dated 25/9/13 tankers were no longer arranged during our works so no further delays were encountered.

"Site Set Up Risk Assessment/Method statement. Utilities Block including showers, lockers, microwave, toaster all provided and well kept RAMS were created/submitted/signed off prior to site start. Numerous local amendments have had to be implemented as Site Permit Issuers require a broader description of proposed works. This has resulted in slight delays often at the eleventh hour."
Purchasing. Design Drawings. Purchasing has been carried out in plenty of time leaving just a minimal amount left to purchase. Late design change regarding the Roof Suspension which resulted in delays. Additional calculations requested to incorporate roof suspension without the original Tirfor suspension. Good control of drawing’s being created/submitted/approved.
Agency Labour Re-locating Benchmark Agency have provided 2 No. Welders and 1 No. Plater who have great work ethic and have proved to be competent. Whilst sub-contractors have been working we have had to re-locate our own staff onto other contracts as only one permit issued for the tank at any time.
Hire / Off-hire Maintenance / certification .Plant & Equipment has all turned up on time and certificated. I need to implement a check system that will flag when plant & equipment already on site requires further pat/visual checks.
"Lead Times Requisitioning Storage Stock Control Surplus / Wasted Materials. No problems with materials. The Terminal has a policy where they take ownership of incoming lifting equipment such as slings, shackles etc.. They carry out an additional check before issuing the kit back to us when we come to need it. We have a secure ten foot container for storage. All waste skips provided and are clearly segregated."
"CAPE (Cold Cutters) Costain (Bit Sand Replacement) CAN (N.D.T, M.P.I of welds). Programme slipped considerably when employing CAPE to carry out the Cold Cutting. CAPE were not able to commence works due to calculations awaiting approval. Their initial price was based upon cutting the floor in large sections. It was agreed on site that cuts had to be made considerably smaller to ensure safe removal. Originally we also envisaged L&M being able to remove plates as they were being cut but the Client was opposed to this idea which meant us demobbing temporarily. Costain nearly complete with their initial replacement and fill. This scope is controlled by client direct but their schedule is critical for our following works. Further visits to be arranged and requested giving 24 hour notice. This scope & responsibility was taken away from us during the contract. CAN have carried out a number of tests and will continue during our works. I am providing CAN with relevant notice of forthcoming requirements. This scope & responsibility was taken away from us during the contract. Experiencing a little difficulty in obtaining required amended reports."
"Document Control. Contract management is essentially being driven by an on-line Documentum process between client and L&M. Various documents including drawings, progress, calculations etc.. have been created and sent to the client for amendment/approval. This process will be implemented throughout the contract and a Data Dossier will be provided on completion. Documentum is no longer in place as AMEC have taken over during our time at site. AMEC have not contacted me to request anything in addition to the Documentum. Draft Dossier has been submitted and swiftly returned with numerous required amendments. As of today (2/5/14) I await my amendments to be approved."
Non-conformances Documented .Quality No non-conformances to date I have a site based file which contains all relevant and necessary quality certificates and procedures. A quality management plan has also been submitted through Documentum as part of the Document control system
"Site Set-up Traffic Management Tool Box Talks Site .Visits Really strong site emphasis on Health, Safety & Welfare. All Crane/Tele-Handler Lifts are supported by Banksman. All concerned areas are sufficiently cordoned off with clear warning signs. Job Specific Talks are carried out and documented within the Permit package. Additional Tool Box Talks are also carried out and recorded. Austin Jones will continue to carry out noise assessments and Tool Box Talks during his site visits."
Waste Management Environmental. Document/Certificates Provided by Client All been created/submitted/approved through Documentum.
"Initial programme duration was never realistic. Although the tender programme was reduce to suit the Clients timescale, it was always unrealistic given the design delivery times."
" Inexperience in actual construction design has let this project down. An in-house tank/silo designer would have speeded things up somewhat. Design changes, especially with the panel manufacturer have caused a real problem. These need to be kept to a minimum after the order has been placed."
 TWD needs to be included in the tender.
" Murphy plant should have to be competitive with external plant hire companies, delivery & collection charges are a real issue."
 More involvement required at order stage to ensure companies can provide what they say they can. Greater inspection during manufacture.
"Cheapest isn’t always the way forward as was shown with the panel supplier, although numerous design changes have not helped matters. Specialist commissioning engineers proved to be very expensive, with little allowance within the tender."
" Understanding of contract / client requirements Administration of contract Change control (including time bar) Communication (including document control, progress meetings) Final Account. QS needs to spend more time on site to get a handle of the works."
"Client adding extra work to scope adding extra time to job and removing focus from main scope. Short working hours (9 hr days, no weekends). All non scope work to be done at the end of the main scope of works and charged accordingly. This should avoid delays to main scope and clarify the difference between the two. Suggest 10 hour days (min) and 8 hrs Sat & possibly Sun."
"Site Set up Construction Method - design of plate location poor Inspections – outsourced to engineering company whose limited tank knowledge lead to overcomplicated and unnecessary inspections leading to delays. LME provided office, canteen & toilets Due to external design on the shell plates location, there was a big risk of distortion to the tank. This was noted at the start and raised to both client & design company but was deemed as acceptable. The client should have insisted on a re design or re working of the scope which would have produced a better standard of work. Prior to commencement of works, an agreed scope for inspection should have been in place that all parties happy with."
Plate design and installation sequence – design element outsourced by client. Company didn’t have much tank experience and design was impractical and massively long winded. Client / LME & designers to agree on design prior to commencement.
 Not used on this job as unaware of TWC until I did the course in Bromborough the week before job was ending.
Agency Labour – local labour used for firewatcher / standby man. Locals are cheaper as don’t have to pay lodge and travel. Can be used more flexibly than staff.Agency Labour – local labour used for firewatcher / standby man. Locals are cheaper as don’t have to pay lodge and travel. Can be used more flexibly than staff.
Plant / Wagons. Most plant turned up on time and with correct items.
Materials. No problems – all sourced by LME and brought to site.
External engineers / Inspections. As detailed in Engineering controls & design sections.
Progress meetings – daily with the client. Estimate – extra time added onto contract as detailed in Progress & programme.
All work undertaken to EEMUA 159 code – had to change some areas to account for tank layout but still within code. Inspection team should have performed a better pre inspection of tank layout prior to drawings being issued for manufacture.
"Site set up – LME Provided welfare. Good set up, close to job and clients office."
Waste – all general waste was put in skips supplied by client Incidents - None
Production of Management of programme. Weekly progress meetings chaired by client were constructive and enabled exposure to potential bottle necks. We avoided impacting other personal and works by prioritising crane usage. Struggled for a short period with obtaining skilled labour due to the Industry being particularly busy.
Site / Office set-up Construction method. Inspections Commissioning Testing Client provided Site Cabin’s which were adequate. RAMS offered up and approved well in advance of site start. N.D.T testing on welding found minor discrepancies resulting in repairs. Hydrotest and inspection of tanks all passed off.
 No non-conformances on purchasing lead times. No changes of design throughout the installations. Drawing control consistent and easy to follow throughout.
"Labour Staff Competence, Training, Experience Struggled for a short period with obtaining skilled labour due to the industry being particularly busy."
Hire / Off-hire Maintenance / certification .A number of minor breakdowns on plant which were addressed and rectified within a few hours of reporting.
Lead Times Requisitioning Incoming Inspection Stores Control Storage Stock Control Surplus / Wasted Materials. Materials bought in good time enabling thorough inspection. Deliveries into site managed on a priority and required only basis. Relevant waste skips managed by client utilised on site.
Financial Impacts Appreciation. Commercial problems with scaffolders resulted in lost days. Painting contractors commended on site for their awareness and implementation of site rules.
"Tender / Estimate Understanding of contract / client requirements Administration of contract Change control (including time bar) Communication (including document control, progress meetings) Final Account. Clear and consistent approach to all administrative aspects. Programme regularly reviewed and updated to capture site progress."
Non-conformances ITP Tank Lining fault. No non-conformances recorded throughout. Inspection and Test Plan capturing various aspects all witnessed and passed off by client. Sub-contractor had to return and repair sections of lining.
Site Set-up Welfare Facilities Drink and drugs tests. Good use of barriers keeping other personnel out of our zone. Welfare facilities clean but many reports of stolen items even from locked lockers Random daily drink and drugs tests being carried out to ensure no personnel putting themselves or others at risk whilst working.
Incidents . Minor leak of oil from a generator resulting in supplier attending to rectify. Quick response from us to initially contain and a thorough report by Austin Jones carried out.
Site Set Up. Programme. This was arranged and carried out the Friday before the official site start. All plant and electrical items had extensive site checks which would have resulted in a lost day if arranged for the same day. With an arranged shut down to follow our works it was essential that we were complete within a strict window. By increasing hours we managed to fulfil our requirement and still come well within budget.
Method of Work .Unfortunately we were not permitted to work on various aspects at the same time. Our proposed methods were clearly defined by way of documentation and were verbally accepted before our works commenced. We had to reassess our methods and even split breaks to ensure that we didn’t lose any additional time because of this. Client accepted and paid for this change.
Purchasing Drawings .Very minimal purchasing required whilst works were taking place. Plenty of up front purchasing with correct levels of required consumables. Good control of drawings being created/submitted/approved. Easily understood by the Site Crew.
"Agency Labour. Due to us being particularly busy we agreed to utilise Benchmark agency to employ two men. Working under one of L&M’s supervisors, these two experienced men fitted in really well and adhered to our installation methods and site rules."
Weld Set/Generator Was provided by AWS. Was brand new and was inspected thoroughly by the Client on arrival. No issues at all during the full course.
Lead Times. Storage. Were strictly met enabling us time to arrange transport. We utilised a hired 10foot lockable store during the course of this installation. Safe and secure.
NDT. Fell under the clients remit but was arranged in order to minimise any down time.
Document Control .All pre site start documentation including calculations offered up and approved before our arrival. Data Dossier including as built and weld log history provided shortly after completion.
Non-Conformances Documented Quality .None to report Quality Management Plan created and located in the Site File.
Traffic Management Tool Box Talks. All offloading supported by Clients own banks man. Clear and sufficient segregation in place to eliminate the chance of crush with personnel. Job specific talks are carried out.
Incidents Waste Management Environmental Document/Certificates .No environmental incidents to report Provided b yClient Environmental Plan created and located in the Site File.
"Production of Management of programme .Began with a delay due to client missing important shell obstructions during their survey. Programme slipped due to a partly inexperienced crew, unfamiliar parts due to a new supplier and the tank being out of shape making installation difficult and longer winded."
Site / Office set-up Construction method Inspections Commissioning Testing. N/A RAMS offered up and approved well in advance of site start. Client inspected and passed off on the 13/8/15. He thanked each crew member for their efforts and commended their efforts.
.No non-conformances on purchasing lead times. No changes of design throughout the installations. Drawing control consistent and easy to follow throughout.
"Labour Staff Competence, Training, Experience .Suffered a little due to partial inexperience. There was also a significant period between installing this cover and our last one so some of the best installation methods had been forgotten by some. The inexperienced guys quickly picked up the required methods and have gained valuable experience for the future."
Hire / Off-hire Maintenance / certification. One minor breakdown on plant which was addressed and rectified within a few hours of reporting. Collection on completion carried out by supplier and supervised by L&M so no need to utilise the client.
Lead Times Requisitioning Incoming Inspection Stores Control Storage Stock Control Surplus / Wasted Materials Materials. bought in good time enabling thorough inspection. Deliveries into the Bromborough Yard first but noted damage during transport. Photographs taken and a meeting with supplier to discuss has been arranged Relevant waste skips managed by client utilised on site.
Financial Impacts Appreciation.

Programme regularly reviewed and updated to capture site progress."
Non-conformances Inspection .No non-conformances recorded throughout. Visual Inspection carried out by client and passed off as sound.
Site Set-up Welfare Facilities. Good use of barriers keeping other personnel out of our zone. Poor and overcrowded due too many other contractors already on site.
Incidents. Small fuel leak not associated to Land and Marine but within our area forced us to stop work for an hour. Client carried out numerous gas checks before allowing us back into the tank to continue.
Programme of works needed to be extended due to the defects in the original floor being worse than the report suggested. Due to Testex missing additional defects L&M should ensure they can access inside the tank before any future works.
Site labour needed to be escorted to and from the WC. Springfield fuels provided a mobile WC unit just outside the tank bund.
Various Design changes were implemented due to NDT report being inaccurate and the suggested scope was changed so tank was repaired to code .New Drawings were produced to Code with the correct repair method.
Hoardings Permits were issued before works commenced.
Job was cost to have 3 men onsite but due to the job specification changing we required additional labour on the job. Cost of labour increased in value from the original scope of works.
Generator .Generator failed but was fixed within a couple of hours.
Alternative steel supplier sourced which would of saved the job £700. Purchasing would not allow us to add a new steel suppler to the system even though the rate per tonne was significantly lower.
 No Non-Conformance noted all deliveries were on time. All material certs were provided by suppliers.
"Tender / Estimate Understanding of contract / client requirements Administration of contract Change control (including time bar) Communication (including document control, progress meetings) Final Account .Clear and consistent approach to all administrative aspects. Programme regularly reviewed and updated to capture site progress. Problems with attaining order numbers to cover extra site work."
 Site was pretty remote and only scaffolding contractor working nearby. Welfare Facilities were good and clean and were close to site works.
 No incidents were recorded during site works All skips were provided by the client and all closed top due to nuclear site regulations.
Programme was extended due to and error with the original sump drawings. Ineos drawing of the sump was different to the old installed sump. Client error as agreed Works were stop start due to not being issued a permit due to REG 7.

"Labour Staff Competence, Training, Experience Utilised Murphy labour in Darren Beckwith : excellent attitude time keeping and willingness to work as a team. All labour was covered by CCNSG and Confined space. Majority of crew unfamiliar with scope but quickly learnt the correct methods. We all worked well as a team and got the job completed on time."
Hire / Off-hire Maintenance / certification. All Plant was well organised and turned up on time. All equipment was PAT tested by Chris Watson. Client issued lights were off poor quality and not enough. Was advised to persevere with what we had.

"Engagement of PTS. Selection of pumps. Positioning of pumps. Level detection. Filling durations. Flow rates. Flow meter positioning. Exceeding permitted flow rate. Discharge rates. Discharge durations. Survey. Sequencing. Filling optimization. Early commencement of filling. Tank cleaning. Control of access to the bund / SIMOPS. Night working (24/7). Water sampling & testing regime. Communication with Portsmouth Water. Filling direct from main. Hydrotest Procedure. This session and sharing this document has already prompted the early engagement. All need to work together collaboratively. In addition, intention is to have a member of PTS based on site as part of the overall mechanical team. Consider whether there are more suitable pumps for the transfer operation. RA to be undertaken to establish whether PTS are willing to position pumps in Ph 2 bund, reducing the length of suction / delivery hose. Generate plot plan & equipment layout drawings for each phase of the process. Based on the above, friction loss calcs to be undertaken to establish if positioning of pumps is suitable. Correct tank dip tape to be purchased. Source suitable digital pressure gauge and ideally establish if this can be linked into the PTS test cabin. Revise filling calculations to take benefit of 23hr daily fill (1hr pump maintenance) and update testing programme to suit. Contact Portsmouth Water to establish allowable filling rates from potable main. Hydrotesting programme to be updated to suit. Update PTS RAMS / Procedure / equipment layout drawings to ensure this is clearly stipulated for the workforce carrying out Ph 2 testing. Provision of an inline instantaneous flow meter for incorporation into the set up. Ultimate solution would be for this to be connected directly into the test cabin, which is to be investigated. No action if same pumps are used as Ph 1 as max pressure will not exceed pipeline design pressure. Ensure this is monitored if pumps are changed. Advise required bodies prior to discharge. No change required – Ensure the same template is used for Ph 2 and add this as an appendix to the hydrotest procedure. Review sequencing on its merits closer to the time, further on in the construction sequence to see if there is any benefit in storing in T0120 until T0100 is ready. This action will remain fluid. Establish if there is any limit on the time water can sit in a tank, before it goes stagnant. No issue foreseen with working in bund with T0120 full, as the tank will then have been tested and integrity proven. View tanks as pairs and monitor programme to manage the lag between the two. To achieve maximum benefit, T0120 would need to be mechanically complete and QA signed off around 10 days after commencement of filling. Monitor on ongoing basis. Risk assessment to be generated to cover access and welding on the roof of T0130, following commencement of filling. nternal wash down post hydrotest to be built into Ferrous Protection SoW from outset of Ph 2. Ph 2 HAZOP session to be arranged to determine required restrictions on bund working, whilst tanks are under hydrotest. Note only. Programme to be discussed at weekly QA meeting, to enable suitable OPA cover to be arranged. Following commencement of testing, then internal lining, we move into a period of 24/7 working, so early communication with OPA Ops. Water testing requirements to be established and regime put in place, to ensure correct sampling is undertaken, however minimises schedule impact. Liaise with Portsmouth water over required date for water and to ascertain available flows. Ascertain pressure of potable main, tapped blind and gauge to be installed. Calculation to be completed to establish whether direct fill is feasible."
Project programme was updated for the novation of the contract to Murphy in June. Lack of and fragmented provision of planning resource has prevented development of the programme and updating of progress. This may ultimately diminish our ability to successfully manage time related commercial issues. Ensure adequate planning resources are committed to projects.
"lass office, satellite yard and fabrication facilities to be set up ahead of the project start. Positive comments from our client regarding the overall set up and separation of carbon & stainless steel consumables. Frequent IT problems hamper regular progress of routine work. Up to one week continuous downtime on company servers. Poor for a modern project in the 21st century, which relies heavily on modern means of effective communication. Site produce excellent RAMS in good time to enable starts to tasks, however the Clients’ approval process is protracted and frequently leads to last minute “just in time” final acceptance. Injection of additional engineering resources to manage a potentially difficult engineering / contractual situation ensured our commercial position was protected and properly managed .No different to any other company (based on experience). Work on building IT which meets the demands of the company."
"Document controller employed to effectively manage the flow of information between the Client and ourselves, and to the wider L&M team."
"Additional resources were made available to produce scaffolding design briefs, ensuring the scaffolding subcontractor delivered drawings and resources on site in time to meet our requirements."
"With the exception of planning resources, sufficient supervisory, engineering, quality and safety personnel have been allocated to the project. There has been significant turnover in both inspection personnel and production resources in the field, partly due to the change over from Daniels to Murphy as the parent company, when some of the original resources could not be retained and partly due to natural turnover of personnel. Top class stainless steel pipe welders have been difficult to source and maintain at the requisite levels, however training to the required standards at the Barnsley facility has ensured the resource levels have been kept as high as possible. Overall the team have proven to be competent and up to the task. The client has made compliments and expressed satisfaction with what we have achieved so far on a very difficult job."
"All permanent materials are supplied by the client. There have been and continue to be problems with the quality of many of the components supplied, particularly with the pipe supports. This has cost the project time. Maintain correspondence to log all issues affecting progress / commercial impact."
"ood tender handover to the initial team, clients requirements understood at the outset. Initial team were installed within the clients’ office for the pre-construction period and while the contractors facilities were being established. This enabled good relationships to develop at the outset, and for L&M to learn the clients way of doing business on a daily basis. This established a launch-pad for the project and good relationships have been maintained to date."
The experience and knowledge of the Quality / inspection team and expert input from the Barnsley facility has ensured that NCR’s are virtually unheard of. On such a technically complex project this is a major positive.
Requisite standards of welfare facilities and maintenance have been maintained from the outset. Sufficient supplies of ppe have been maintained.
No concerns to raise. A positive on a project which has exceptional environmental and natural habitat issues.
Ladders not allowed on piling rigs .Ensure MEWP costed in tender when pricing piling works. 2 HAVS detectors used on hand tools which affects price and time to get to site .Check with client or read specs .3 Lift supervisor needed on all MEWPs and piling rigs. Debateable – suggest that this is a PC role .4 Hardstanding areas – bigger than tender allownace All concrete – no Type 1 due to spragging of wagons and cost of repairs .5 IT installation – costs not enough More expensive than first thought. Allowances to be bigger in future tenders 6 Programme errors Certain links were identified by site team as being not correct. Will review them and make sure that Planner is made aware of them and why.
"Time of year the scheme was completed may have increased the chances f poor weather and increased water within the ground on site. Re-Authority required prior to starting on site. Maintenance tamping postponement. Land Access - • Inclement weather experienced in Nov/Dec • Works required the embankment to be worked so vegetation was lost. • Increase scope • RF8 estimate not sufficient/acknowledged - Baselined at RF8 was starting point, however additional scope was captured and added to ATC (increase of roughly £700k). - Lack of communication between the Pic and NR team - wasn’t highlighted at the Pic (prior to going to site). • No land access could be secured for headwall works at 66m 1660yds. • Low internal NR resource required to outsource surveyor to an also low resourced external surveying company."
Scheme delivered to programme and cost and delivered to the required quality of the client. • Good understanding of the scope of the scheme during planning stage. • Robust programme at the outset. · All personal involved pulled together and worked as a team • Regular communication/updates from site as well as site visits • JMS site management.
"Failure 1 - At Heyford Hills (66M 1110y to 66m 1122y). Failure 2 - At Heyford Hills (66m 1188y to 66m 1210y). Look at better connecting the designer into the JMS constructability reviews. This was raised as a potential improvement area on the back of the scheme. • Wet weather in the preceding weeks leading to high soil moisture levels and associated porewater pressures. • Requirement to trim/rework the cutting slope in order to install the cess drainage through this section of earthwork. It would appear that this has resulted in a slight steepening of the cutting slope at this location. • Temporary absence of vegetation on the slope, allowing more rapid infiltration of surface water and softening of the shallow soils. The lack of “binding” vegetation will increase the potential for shallow movement/slumping, opening up small tension cracks which in turn allows surface water to penetrate deeper. • Temporary absence of vegetation and cropping in the adjacent field, allowing more rapid flow of surface water towards the cutting. Although the corresponding catchment area is small, the increase in flow rate could have contributed to the instability. • In combination with the presence of reworked ground at the crest could potentially have reduced infiltration rates for surface water into the underlying strata, thereby increasing run off. - Potentially overly focussed on designing to budget. • Wet weather in the preceding weeks leading to high soil moisture levels and associated porewater pressures. The low permeability nature of the clay strata forming the cutting mean that the beneficial effect of the counterfort drains would have not yet taken effect. • General ground disturbance associated with the installation of deep counterforts and cess drainage works. The excavation activities will have resulted in a change in soil stresses and soil moisture in the immediate vicinity of the dig, possibly triggering localised movement which then developed over time due to other factors. In general terms, digging into a large, sensitive cutting with marginal FoS will never be without risk, as some movement/disturbance of the surrounding ground will inevitably occur during construction. In this case, the fact that the earthwork has suffered significant movement in the past, resulting in localised planes of weakness may also have been a factor. • Traditionally JMS have done the buildability reviews internally, rather than inviting the designer to these."
Feedback from the RAM team advised that the capturing of the new drainage assets was of low quality. Quality. • Lack of sufficient training? Lack of support/direction from NR asset management team on what they’re looking for? • The Pole Star software used by JMS didn’t provide information required by System Support Manager. NCRs raised for failures above.
"People. Programme. Client. Supplier Relationships. Own workforce utilised for self delivery beneficial. Adhoc 29hrs blockades over a period of different phases, 4hr programme reporting was conducted and went well in the grand scheme of things. Internally we thought the 4hr reporting was overkill as hand back of the line could have been granted at any point if required. Scheme was delivered on programme overall with the preparation shifts and finishing off shifts either side of the blockade. Matt Clarke and Jack Harveys visits during the blockades was beneficial as we got to iron out design changes from problems that had arisen on the shift. Keyline where very helpful during the works. Lingwood provided a good service, on time and staff where helpful. Wildes provided a good service during the design phase."
"Bid Process. Price and Value. Forecasting. Various price submission based on adhoc extended access so works had to be priced over various scenarios based on possession access for each phase. ATC price realistic once finally agreed. Extra value of installation was achieved during the blockades which subsequently resulted in a cost saving to the client if this had been conducted during further blockades/ROTR. A robust forecast wasn’t in place, a bit more time could have been in place but this all linked to limited time involved in trying to get the PAF in place by all parties for the various phases."
"Design Phase. Temporary Works. Buildability. A lot of scope changes throughout the scheme by the asset team/designers caused additional delays in the design phase of the scheme. JMS struggled to get the design signed of due to lack of RAM resources. Proprietary products were utilised. MGF provided design assistance for the scheme. Lack of TWCs in general and we struggled to source one for every shift of the blockade, eventually had to bring construction manager in for cover on day shift of the blockade. The design was valued engineered and depths of the dig was kept as shallow as possible. Considering that we did so much GI we still encountered unforeseen problems in the ground strata in the up cess. The scheme couldn’t have been realistically built in the ROTR at Lea Green which were generally 4-5 hrs of possession in general and would have taken around 30 Saturday nights at a substantial cost. In general these works need to be conducted in extended possessions as we did on this occasion."
"SHESQ. Plant. IT. Tom Platt attended all blockades and provided good assistance to the team. 1 st 29hr blockade suffered from plant breakdown lost us a 4hrs and separate RRV had to be sourced from Golborne. Issue never reported via site team via NCR due to worry of damaging working relationship. Det Coms stolen by operative on blockade, unknown who due to no signing off at stores due to no storeman due to only being two 29hr Blockades. Second blockade all det coms signed out. IT in main compound was fine and assistance in installation was of a sufficient standard."
"QSRA Programme not representative of times on site. Weekly progress meetings was positive. Collaborative working between all even when under pressure. Last minute integration, integrated worksites not utilised and additional staff required to expand the worksite. JMS disagree with Network Rails assumption that the was too much contingency time in QSRA programme, programme was back on time for P’Way installation works. Continue with this approach. Continue working collaborate. Following T-14 no other approved links to be approved."
"WOF Sign off delayed, cables not addressed at WOF, Sign off of WOF delayed. Approximately 6 month time[1]lapse for this. GI Philosophy. During Design development in the Pre ATC works Network Rail budget did not allow for extensive investigation works, ie Trail pits between jack arches and on approaches. Great attention to detail during Construction phase. The bogmats used for the SPMT on the SDJ line worked well in assisting temporary works requirements for SPMT delivery. Early WOF involvement, additional time within program for multi discipline schemes. High level approach to design undertaken to mitigate risks. Network Rail to allow additional funding to develop investigation works, to enable robust design development. Level of experience in the Project Team reflected in successful Construction methodology. Delivery teams should work closely with Network Rails asset team to reduce the level of Temporary works requirements where possible."
"ssues with Subcontractor Pod-trak, during installation works JMS Operatives were required to support Pod[1]trak due to the potential of falling behind in the programme. Prior to core weekend change in Safety Critical names, names not correct with site attendees, Pod-trak not capable of using online Ontrac SWP’s. Traffic Management was required to be altered prior to the Core works, this was following the Council withdrawing the original agreed road closure that was in place. An amendment was made to temporarily remove the traffic island to allow for a contraflow system. JMS responded well to public interactions and entering the worksite. No accidents or incidents. Excellent use of COVID-19 Lateral Flow testing for all site attendees, use of NHS reporting system. Site Team remained calm and controlled throughout the Core works, Level of experience in the Site Team reflected in successful Core works delivery. JMS challenging unsafe activities and behaviour with Subcontractors. Stakeholder – Avanti West Coast were an excellent Partner with Network Rail. During Saturday night Possessions and the Core Possession night time working, the Station lights were left on by Station Management to provide additional lighting for the Construction works. Excellent work from Rope Access Subcontractor – Vertical Access Subcontractor. JMS to take up the issue of Safety Critical name changes and SWP’s with Pod-trak from a contractual aspect. Ensure early engagement and regular update is maintained with the local authority prior to core works. Continue with this level of communication. Continue with Company procedure of all site attendees providing a negative test prior to arriving at site. Continue with other Core works. Continue to follow Company values. Continue with building positive relationships with Key Stakeholders, early engagement. Where possible early engagement with Station management to use such system for future works. Vertical Access to be sent future ITT."
Project managed effectively from all aspects of the team with no specific personal or project issues . Project delivered successfully with a gain return position.
"Challenges from design stage through to implementation. Parapet solid panels installed incorrectly during the first possession and subsequently there was a return visit required to rectify the issues. Late payment to statutory undertaker had the potential to be a showstopper. No issues with the supply of the PCC units. Planned works delayed due to COVID outbreak at Salford depot. Due to the timing of the works and the end of a framework agreement there was slight delay due to the frameworks contract from Balfour Beaty to Network Plus. An element of the manufacturing of polystyrene failed quality control checks. Over ordered quantity to start and negotiated settlement with supplier. No other. Assistance with the installation of the polystyrene blocks and waterproofing. No reported issues or concerns with waterseal. Initial finished product not to expected standards but rectified following discussion. Attended site without PTS/TVP’s Site team working during the day shift not to Ainscough usual standards and JMS team assisted in the lifting arrangements. No issues with supplier. Mobilisation efficiently, additional pins added as good practice with no issues from supplier. There was a further JMS scheme that ran alongside this project and the supplier was more than accommodating for the additional requirements. Relationship between JMS, TGP and NR requires a full project cycle review and lessons learnt to be implemented on future schemes. Cabin installation was sub let. Network Rail to review alternative suppliers that can be utilised for future schemes. NCR raised against supply chain Clarity and specific dates required in contracts issued on future schemes Programme of key dates required for design implementation etc Project review with supplier to be held. Review internal payment processes for future schemes Alternative telephone and wifi supplied for farmer via JMS IT team. Good working relationship and went over and above to assist the project team. Works being completed during a pandemic and with ENW having nominated suppliers who can work on assets there was nothing that could be done regarding this specific delay. Early involvement with stats providers that will help in programming of works to avoid key interchanges such as this one in futire. Future schemes to potentially be treated like steelwork and vesting agreements. Good working win-win relationship with supplier. Positive feedback to be presented to supplier. Post construction works meeting to be held with supplier. Names and competency of team members to be confirmed in advance of the core weekends Contingency plan to be provided on future schemes Competency evidence i.e., AP and supervisor to be provided. Feedback to Ainscough regarding the level of expertise to be supplied on future schemes. Positive feedback to be presented to supplier. Full project life cycle review to be completed between JMS and TGP. Murphy Plant cabins and accommodation to be utilised on future schemes as a preference."
"ue to adverse weather conditions, additional bricklayers employed via agency supply chain. 3.2 Resource to be held during demobilisation and site closure."
"An element of the manufacturing of polystyrene failed quality control checks. Proved to be a sustainable option and is being carried forward on to other schemes being delivered by the team. Design re-visited and reviewed following initial budget constraints and requirements for initial design detail given location of structure. Initial programme constraints as Form001 sat with mining engineer for a substantial amount of time and subsequently Wardell Armstrong were employed as an independent party to assess the reports and verify the mining risk on the project. One stage / Two stage diversions. All plant and equipment supplied via Murphy Plant team. Crane pad temporary works successful and the requirement was engineered over and above to ensure delivery of the scheme. Service bay – the requirement to temporarily support the service bay. Propping of pier during construction was implemented well. Liaise with design supply and incorporate similar methods into future similar infill schemes. Review of design earlier within the process as this could prevent return work and unproductive working time. Possible Independent mining assessment to be included earlier within the design stages on future projects? Two stage diversion was discounted due to budget on the scheme. Successful delivery of the scheme. Had the services been diverted in a 2 stage diversion there would not have been a requirement to temporarily support the service bay. Site Team installed, implemented, and removed the required propping effectively with no buildability on site issues."
"Un-chartered cables discovered within the redundant span. Further investigation to central pier could have been an advantage during design development to remove the requirement for the extensive propping and construction sequence needed for the infill. Limited programme. AFC’s signed on the day of the start of the core possession. PAF received from Network Rail 18/12/2020. Utilising the 2nd OROR possession was beneficial. Standard and size of site setup of a good standard. All required paperwork for start on site was completed and issued in advance of works commencing. More in-depth surveys at Pre-ATC to ascertain all cables, services and obstructions within the working area. To be reviewed on future schemes. Works had originally been planned to commence prior to the Christmas break but due to budget constraints the start on site date was delayed until the first day back in the New Year. This is turn put the site team under pressure from day 1 of mobilising. Not acceptable and must be challenged on future schemes. PAF received 2 days before the Christmas Break imported risk into the start on site date which was the first day back in the New Year. PAF’s to be awarded in advance on future schemes to allow for sites to be fit to start. PAF received 2 days before the Christmas Break imported risk into the start on site date which was the first day back in the New Year. PAF’s to be awarded in advance on future schemes to allow for sites to be fit to start. Following the inclement weather during the month of January and February there was programme pressure on the site team to complete the entire bridge removal and installation during the 1st OROR. The 2nd OROR was then utilised to complete the infill and installation of PCC units on the redundant span."
"NEWTS. Haviwear. Housekeeping. Service diversions best practice was not adhered to. Full focus required for full lifetime of project (including demobilisation and closeout). 2 x Land drainage consent required, and programme was tight. Review natural England requirements and payments in advance on future schemes, the permit was issued on the day of starting on site which was more good luck that judgement. Havi-wear usage to be managed and monitored more effectively on future schemes. Housekeeping in general to be improved on future schemes and especially when demobilising site. Future schemes 2 stage diversion to be considered in more detail. Add milestones for consents etc onto programmes."
One stage / Two stage diversions to be reviewed. Two stage diversion to be the preferred option on future schemes. This eliminates the risk of working in and around the live assets.
"ATC included for footpath diversion and due to budget restrictions, this item was removed. During the construction phase and due to complaints from residents. This placed further pressure on the site team to construct the diversion alongside the main construction activities. Excellent working relationship with the local residents. Project budgets to be reviewed in advance and based off FR08 details to ensure that all critical elements of the works are included within the Project ATC. Continue this relationship onto other schemes."
All staff had relevant competency and training for works being undertaken. Recycling the polystyrene blocks back to source.
"Worked safely around services. Cadent supervision. No accidents or incidents. Mining – Programme restrictions due to delay in responses and conclusion inconclusive. JMS instructed independent consultant. NEWTS present within NE field. IP and MP Gas main. Mobilisation after Christmas period (budget). Single service diversion plan and not 2 stage. Inclement weather during concrete and blockwork activities. Innovation – polystyrene blocks. Although not ideal the workforce worked in and around the live services in a controlled and safe manner with no accidents or incidents. Cadent supervision whilst working in and around the 2 x mains within the vicinity of the structure. Scheme completed with no accidents or incidents. Possible Independent mining assessment to be included earlier within the design stages on future projects? Review natural England requirements and payments in advance on future schemes, the permit was issued on the day of starting on site which was more good luck that judgement. Cadent supervision whilst working in and around the 2 x mains within the vicinity of the structure. Works had originally been planned to commence prior to the Christmas break but due to budget constraints the start on site date was delayed until the first day back in the New Year. This is turn put the site team under pressure from day 1 of mobilizing. Two stage diversion was discounted due to budget on the scheme."
"Issues with the design relating to the raker repairs due to insufficient surveys carried out by the design team. 2 Platforms ran simultaneously which created an opportunity for the works to finish sooner through efficient delivery. Recyclable sheeting fixed to hoardings instead of plywood, which creates a professional finish. No Trial holes took place for the scaffolding footing. Scaffold Designer to attend a site visit for the design. Inaccessible areas not being inspected initially. Dagger board survey to be undertaken at Delap stage. Compound size was correct for the size of project. Materials proof of source. Pricing job more accurately. Isolation team to provide shift reports. Utilising space in the station. Track mats to be turned opposite way round – to avoid slip hazard. Opportunities for other members of the team to attend site. Management of Orchard (New Contractors). Protecting works carried out. Scaffold standard would block the signal. To write to Arcadis to demonstrate why the design was insufficient -- WB and ZR to lead - Engineer/Operations to be on site while surveys take place - On future projects ensure adequate access is in place along with any de vegetation works ahead of fabrication surveys being untaken. - Communication between site team and engineering team regarding surveys. When programming look at using the same delivery process. Continue to use on other projects • To ensure TW designs take into consideration fire regulations. Trial holes must be carried out on all future projects. • Future subcontract ITTs must request Scaffolders designer to attend site for 1 day to conclude survey site conditions. Raise issues in Design Review Meetings - NR and JMS to attend hole point - Designers to have solutions as best they can - All inaccessible areas to be highlighted. Hold Point in the programme - Line and level survey to be carried out by engineers. Continue to source adequate site compounds. Raise in PTI meetings with subcontractors - Raise NCR against subcontractors if the material proof of source are not provided - Split cost of materials until proof has been provided. Future estimates to be priced and compared to previous schemes. Email Mel Dickenson to share with the wider business. Continue to communicate with the station staff, to build a good rapport. Orientation of mats to be considered on future compound set ups. Guide new contractors with the ways that we work Face to face handover with subcontract supervisor and JMS site manager. Manage hold points/ handover points. Walkout to take place with scaffold design - Ensure the surveys the designers carry out are enough for TW also."
Early completion (excluding additional works requested) .9 week programme reduced to 7 weeks.
Foundations Duct between sleepers Possession work .Foundations poured all in one – reduced programme time. Enables concrete at the far side of the track to be poured in normal working hours – saving on the costs of having to open a batching plant and the additional cost of a pump on a Saturday night. Crane was installed prior to possession and all bridge components were pre delivered.
Good quality design. Lead to no issues onsite.
Staff Labour. Unavailability of working foreman. Unavailability of JM labour Cannock region to review direct staff requirements for forthcoming jobs.
Eco welfare cabins. All welfare through eco-cabins – high quality and well received by the client.
RMF Concrete bases RMF Fences Murphy International. Good quality service Difficulty resourcing fences to carry out works in the required time scales. [Where possible all subcontractors need to be procured before the start of the scheme] Installed bridge in 4 hours – no problems.
Steel work .Excellent quality of steelwork delivered from Murphy International.
Eco-welfare cabins No accidents or incidents .Well received & high quality Meeting zero harm/safety culture objectives.
Track mats .Saved on the amount of aggregates required on the job.
"Insufficient time in programme for installation of GRP to trestle section of platform. Confirmation required from contractor with regards in installation periods. With more information on supply, install & resources."
"Ground Investigations. Instruction from Network Rail not to go forward with GI, as a results sheet piles had to be re-design during constructions works, affecting the programme. In future any works involving stabilising ground must - have a GI."
"Buildability .Capita Symmonds .Incorrect survey information, design does not take account time constraints of rules of route possession; platform had to be brought back to standard each night. Slow response with TQs, poor contactability, preference not to use Leigh Collier team again."
Site Visits. Temporary Works Designer to visit site with Construction CRE to discuss and review temporary works before scheme starts.
"Staff Labour Full time Site Manager and Supervisor, correct resourcing of Murphy’s supervision (day/nights). However, preference would be to have a further Foreman to provide constant direct supervision of works Majority of works was subcontractor (around 80%), would prefer a more 50/50 split, this would free up more supervision time. Further to this, subcontracting the work can lead to inconsistent supply and quality of workforce."
"In-house/External Plant Hire .Majority of road rail plant & welfare sourced from Murphy London reducing transport costs and reducing carbon footprint. Try and utilise, as much as possible, in-house plant hire from local depot to reduce costs, specifically road rail plant."
"Tactiles .Poor quality tactile, and non-compliant delivered, ordered through keyline. Ensure correct type is delivered in future."
"Early Subcontract Involvement GRP Collaborative working with subcontractors, TVP Workers. Consistent issue of late appointment of sub[1]contractors. Where possible hire as many subcontractors before the job hits site, and arrange a site visit. Ensure that the GRP subcontractor is a supply & install lump sum contract. Supply only is difficult due to a shortage of install only subcontractors. Murphy provision of road rail plant to aid subcontractors was most cost and programme effective way of working Using TVPs for tarmac subcontractors, giving a wider base of higher quality workforce as opposed to restricted pool of PTS certified tarmac subcontractors."
"PTIs. Client .When conducting PTIs, request from subcontractors that a knowledgeable construction manager attends PTIs. Lack of response from the client, draw attention to the client that when a payment is submitted, if it is not responded to then we are entitled to full payment when due date arrives. Frequent meetings with TOC, building a good relationship lead to trouble free working relationship."
Good finish .Attention to detail and good workmanship has left a good finish on the job.
"Safety Critical Staff Incidents. Daily Hazard Board. When working on a platform, allowance should be made for a COSS at all times. Bridge strike occurred from an RRV during possession, although undesirable, Murphy’s staff investigation was carried out and a safety briefing was disseminated through the company. RRV operations will now be covered in greater detail in WPPs. Daily hazard board used frequently, raising awareness of unforeseen hazards."
"Eco Cabins. Utilisation of Eco Cabins, insulated, more energy efficient, reduced costs."
"Mobile Broadband. To be utilised where possible, preferably on every site, aids document submission and email receipt."
Cages being designed at 16M in length caused issues with pushing them into a pile. Cages were stopping with around 3-4M still left to go into pile. We overcome this problem by having the cages tapered at the bottom 2 metres and using a plate compactor with a guide to push over the top of the cage with the digger to vibrate the cage the last few metres.
Cages stopping with 3-4M left to go into pile due to the length of cage being pushed into the bored and concreted CFA pile. Cages were redesigned with a tapered end and used a plate compactor to vibrate cage in the final few metres.
"Programme Produced Management of Programme .More detailed Programme to be produced on time and agreed between workshop management, engineers and forman fitters. Before refurbishment commences and regularly updated at least monthly to ensure progress is being measured. More Communication needed between Management/supervision and team to manage programme more efficiently."
Commissioning needs to be completed in one period and not spread over two/three separate periods. Pump failure during Testing /commissioning lead to longer lead times and extra work.
" Management of subcontract designers (including communication) Management of internal designers .Lead Times Too Long on TBM Refurbishment Spares better pre order planning is required .This should be one of the first tasks when the machine is being/has been stripped. Innovative Design Change to Sealing System will improve performance in EPB, simpler to use, less downtime for TBM in Tunnel. Drawing Register needs better control. All Drawings to be filed on F: Drive for review. Innovative Design Change to Sledges, Wheels added to the gantries, to reduce drag and Friction to improve efficiency of the TBM and improve safety with prevention of Tow Chain Failure. Screw conveyor re lined inside – extra work Unloader Sledge Strengthened - extra work."
" Labour Overhead very High, Very Competent .Labour stretched because of lack of planning and communication and because of second TBM Refurbishment running alongside the 131 TBM refurbishment."
Maintenance / certification .Plant and Equipment Hire / off Hire for refurbishment minimal. Continue with active monitoring via allocation sheets and Maxcel on future refurbishments.
Lead Times on Caterpillar based equipment very long also with Gearbox Repair Supplier and Pump Suppliers. Communication needs to improve between JMS and Supplier who need to be engaged more often with a view to getting equipment back on time. Stock Control System required lots of time taken up hunting/sourcing equipment and spares in KT. Needs stock system for condition reporting and sourcing equipment in the workshop/depot.
Minimal sub contract work. Caterpillar Representative brought in by workshop saved the group thousands by inspecting and repairing the main drive bearing that the manufacturers had written off as scrap .Highly Competent and experienced.
"Communication poor at times. Regular progress meetings will take place on future Refurbishments involving all key personnel more engagement needed with supervisors, engineers and team."
 Records of all TBM Refurbishment are kept on the F: Drive. Hard Copies could be administered better. More NCRs could be raised.
 Site Set up in adequate with a view that the TBM cannot be fully built up in our current location any longer which led to the front end being commissioned separately. Better facility required.
"PTM12 was priced on a lump sum basis, this was reduced during the tender negotiation process in order to gain a commercial advantage, and this was done on the basis of increased revenue from the hire. The actual cost ended up showing an overspend .However the workshop team managed to uncover additional allowance for TBM refurbishment in the New Cross Project allowance reducing the final overspend."
"Improvements for future refurbishments : If lump sum amounts are given for the refurbishment they need to be a robust estimate and not reduced taking into account the hire revenue. The tender amount for refurbishment should not be discounted in order to win the contract these adjustments should come off the bottom line. Allowance given to the workshop should be clear if project fee included or not. Estimating need to highlight all financial entitlement to the workshop from the project. If additional refurbishment work is carried out on TBM to improve performance this is to be suggested, priced and agreed as a variation with site before any work is carried out."
Tool failure. After drilling commenced large volumes of water under pressure (artesian) were encountered. Client dissatisfaction. The borehole was due to be drilled to 150m depth. Steel disposable casing is required to keep soil open when drilling. Deep overburden thickness and variable soil caused the casing to break in the first and second attempt at drilling. Casing successfully installed in third attempt and bit sheared off and jammed down hole. Hole successfully drilled on fourth attempt. A third more experienced driller was sent to site for the 4rd and 4th attempt. Drilling stopped to let ground surface absorb water being produced from borehole. Client dug drainage ditches to divert water onto field. Water management caused time delays. After drilling completed and plant demobbed from site. Client complained about mess left behind. Drillers sent back out to tidy up casing off cuts.

Client planning. After drilling commenced large volumes of water under pressure (artesian) were encountered. After borehole completion water leaking from outside of borehole casing. Extra works required to lay drainage pipework. The borehole was due to be drilled to 170m depth. The home owner/client instructed our client (the heat pump installer) to change borehole depth to 200m. An extra 30m does not take long to drill and it was agreed we would drill the extra depth with no further cost to maintain good relations with our client. The home owner again changed his mind as wanted the borehole to be drilled to 220m against the advice of our client. Drilling slowed down dramatically due to water pressure counteracting air pressure on drill rig. Borehole could not be progressed deeper than 180m. A second shallower borehole was drilled to 54m depth. Borehole wellplug didn’t plug borehole. Water leaking up side of borehole casing and draining into trench which was flooding garden and a risk to building foundation. A drain was connected from leaking boreholes to field drain to removed excess water away from house.
"All personnel and plant arrived on site and working to plan .Although extra time was required to carry out extra works, all methods of works carried out timeously."
"Client changed design after site commencement. Labour. Material. The client changed borehole depth, difficult ground conditions required two boreholes and installation of drain.

"Tool failure. Deep casing required. Plant brakedown. The borehole was due to be drilled to 60m depth. Steel disposable casing is required to keep soil open when drilling. Deep overburden thickness consisting of sand and gravel caused hammer to jam in hole. Hammer retrieved and bit sheared off down borehole.

Tool failure .The boreholes were due to be drilled to 200m depth. Steel disposable casing is required to keep soil open when drilling. Shallow overburden was encountered however rock type was sandstone and limestone and very hard to drill. Deep casing was required to advance into rockhead through weathered sandstone to seal boreholes from potential water leaks. A heavy duty hammer was brought in to advance borehole to depth.

"Blasting quotation did not allow for a profiling visit. Following submission of the blasting quotation, additional rates were given for the haulage of the drilling rig and hire of the helicopter. These rates did not include for overheads or profit. Blasting quotation did not stipulate quantity on which the rates were based. As the quantity actually blasted was less than expected, the revenue was reduced. Following the profiling visit, it was evident that the quantity expected for blasting was not available. Quotation was based on using 25% ammonium nitrate in the explosive charge (as in previous blasts). The holes drilled were all wet and ammonium nitrate could not be used and 100% packaged explosives had to be used. Include cost of profiling visit in future quotations. Include an allowance for overheads and profit in rate for haulage. As the client receives a copy of the invoice for the hire of the helicopter,an allowance for overheads and profit should be included in the blasting quotation. Stipulate quantity upon which rates are based with a proviso to increase rates if the quantity is reduced. Client to be advised of reduced quantity and possible additional charges. Future quotations to Include rates for using 100% packaged explosives in addition to rates for using 25% ammonium nitrate / 75% packaged explosives."

The grasscrete road was installed early on in the project and was used throughout as a haul road and access road. When it was originally installed the ‘pockets’ were filled with gravel. Over course of its use the pockets became filled with clay and spoil. As part of the compound reinstatement works the grasscrete road is to be fully cleaned out, then top soiled and seed.

Good support team in Kieran Meehan and his team at Golborne and Leah Grayson and team at Dinnington. The excavator hired from Wilkinson was of a poor standard. It was stated that rubber tracks were required due to some road travel required, and although it did have them they were well worn and missing in places. Better quality external plant is required. A pecker was requisitioned for the 3T excavator. The Plant Dept. informed site that wasn’t one available but was for the 2T excavator. Site accepted this offer even though production would be slightly reduced, but delivery was still 1 week later than requested. A mobile diesel bowser was delivered to site. It was soon discovered that the battery was dead. This was reported to the Plant Dept. The fitter replaced the solar panel only. The problem still remained. A second visit by the Fitter was required to install a new battery. Before plant is delivered to site it needs to be checked is fit for purpose. Fitters shouldn’t be required for newly delivered plant."

The temporary welfare cabin supplied from Sibcas for the mound works was found to have the following issues: noisy generator, small diesel tank, small drying room. The standard of welfare unit was lower than expected and caused some discomfort on site. Better quality units to be supplied or alternative suppliers to be utilised in future. Welfare cabins are required for the Newt fencing and grid works. We selected Garic who have supplied much better cabins that Sibcas. In order to cancel the requirement for out of hour’s security, NG instructed EAN to park their large plant items inside the substation. Although this has saved the client some budget, it can delay Operatives being able to access plant when required, due to the requirement of a CP NSI 8(full) key holder to open/close the gate."

 Plant Nappies. Use of plant nappies opposed to drip trays that collect water and require emptying often resulting in ground contamination. The nappies are also easy to handle and provide more effective spillage control.
"Tender Programme’s unrealistic to complete works on certain schemes. Site constraints not fully assessed prior to starting works, thus affecting progress. Site Managers unable to produce their own programmes Insufficient steel condition surveys carried out prior to starting on site causing progress delays. Projects on average have taken double the amount of time that was submitted to the Client in the tender programmes. Greater review of site constraints that could affect progress to be carried out and then develop programme accordingly. Items to consider as follows: • OLE – If OLE is present and minimal clearance between bridge soffit and OLE the correct procedure to be followed pre start to attain encapsulation scaffold design to be approved prior to starting works (not during). This enables works to progress 7 days per week not just Sat nights only. • Winter working – Programme works if possible from March to September which will enable more favourable Environmental conditions. If projects do have to proceed during winter months then must have a means of controlling the environment i.e. Scaffold Encapsulation, if this isn’t possible then works should not be carried out from Oct-Feb as environment continually out of specification to paint, thus causing delays and financial losses • Limited working time available during possessions – If projects can be carried out during Sat nights only then programme to be realistic to accommodate 1 shift per week. Programme/Cost to be reviewed and compared against working during bank holiday blockade’s opposed to 1 day per week. Microsoft Project training to be given to Site Managers, improving their IT skills to be able to produce their own programmes. If still not confident excel versions to be produced for JMS planner to write into MS Project. Programmes also need to be reviewed and updated by Site Managers. Project Managers to develop realistic programmes with Site Managers prior to works. JMS to offer the client an in depth steel condition survey of all schemes following issue of remit. This will identify the amount of anticipated steel repairs prior to starting on site. The steel condition at sites such as Lodge Road was significantly worse than stated on the examination reports due to the reports being out dated. Time was lost identifying all repair areas post blast and then attaining design approval, the majority of the repairs could have been identified pre blast prior to starting on site."
"At Dansteed Way JMS utilised a completely transient site mobilisation which worked very well. Works were Saturday nights only and the site team manoeuvred all required plant and materials to the project using transit vans, and towing the compressor. Mobile welfare facilities also utilised. Following completion of the shift all plant and welfare taken back to Cannock yard. This made considerable cost savings on Site Prelims opposed to having a complete site set up and eliminated the need for 24/7 security."
"FJD Consulting. Pre start inspection by designer .Performed well throughout the duration of the contract, especially as Simon Moon previously worked for NWR, had a good understanding of client requirements. Would recommend for use of future schemes. As previously stated, detailed examination of the bridge condition to be carried out following issue of remits. Certain instances design relied too heavily on previously carried out detailed exam reports which were outdated."
Scaffold/encapsulation .PHD noted to provide a very tightly sealed encapsulation at Chesham Road and general good service. Would recommend using them as first choice sub-contractor for future schemes.
"Staff. Labour. Paint Inspectors. A number of Site Managers utilised for delivering works previous role was Site Supervisor. Some learned fast and progressed well others struggled, especially commercially as had not been taught how to submit extensions of time, variations, etc. Suggest commercial awareness training for all Site Supervisors/Managers which should have a positive impact commercially. JMS were awarded this Enhanced Spend package of works based on carrying out grit blast and paint “in-house” to improve quality as a lessons learned from previous poor works carried out from sub-contractors. This worked well to a certain degree in that 3 direct GB&P operatives were employed who did produce good quality works. However, at periods there were 8 projects running at the same time thus agency labour had to be utilised. The quality of these men was generally poor; a lot of time and extra costs were wasted due to poor workmanship. Good quality recommended GB&P operatives to be sourced for the next projects. JMS hired two agency Paint Inspectors for the duration of the projects. Both had excellent work ethic and competent at carrying out environmental readings, completing QA etc. However, when comparing them to AWC Corrosion’s inspectors, hired by NWR they were massively sub-standard. Lacked experience and didn’t speak up enough when there were site issues which could have been avoided. Would highly recommend using AWC as inspectors for JMS if not hired by the Client, otherwise require alternative inspectors that can provide better guidance and mitigate problems on site."
"Abraclean plant. Plant. Numerous issues with plant failing on possessions leading to programme/cost over runs-JMS need to tie in supplier to costs from contract set up-I.E they have a fitter on call. JMS need to task one operative with the clean return of plant to avoid incurring cleaning costs. All hired plant to be protected if necessary from overspray using clear film wrap prior to use, this includes Mewps, scaffold towers etc to avoid cleaning costs when off hired."
"Paint stores to be commissioned & in use at start of project. Murphy P&T struggled to source heated paint stores for winter months, this will need to be addressed for future projects."
"Linear. Treefellars. RMF .As discussed previously, some poor quality labour provided by Linear who were the only supplier of men. Good quality labour to be sourced with greater option of labour suppliers for future works. Generally provided a good service, worth noting in regards to de-veg that it should be carried out at the end of the project (unless its causing obstruction) as client can sign off as complete. Some sites required a second visit as the vegetation had grown back prior to handover. Brickwork labourers generally good standard."
Programme. Greater involvement/communication from the QS and Site Managers. Cost plans to be reviewed with the Site Manager and PM monthly. Programme reviews and revisions to be carried out monthly with PM and SM.
Steel works. JMS Direct GB&P Op’s. Excellent quality of steelwork & site team from Harrisons led to seamless installation of steel repairs. Recommend them for future schemes. Excellent quality of work with good understanding of specification requirements.
No accidents throughout the course of all projects which is very good. Eco cabins provided at Dansteed Way when working for the beginning phase of the project were excellent and provided a professional site set up and good perception to the client.
Acoustic sound barriers Rubber mats/blocks. Waste management .Used to reduce noise from compressor. Used to further reduce noise & noise monitoring undertaken. No incidents & waste segregated before leaving site.
"Steel Brickwork Repairs Completing schemes during blockades JMS encountered significant quantities of steel repairs throughout the schemes which were far greater than the original scope of works. This at first seemed problematic but from the utilisation of an excellent designer (FJD) and competent sub-contractors, JMS delivered high quality steel repairs which resulted in significant profits and good client satisfaction. Certain schemes had significant amounts of brickwork repairs. This also proved considerably profitable when attaining a price from sub-contractors to carry out the brickwork repairs as a package, using the highest price received as a basis of JMS’ to the client in our price but then using agency staff to carry out the works which worked out significantly less. Completing works at the Flyover, Camden during 2 No. blockades at Christmas and Easter opposed to over a 4 month programme saved the client huge sums (J Coleman quoted £300,000). Further enhancing good will to JMS for delivering efficient works."
"With current standards slowly being replaced by euro codes, we were being faced with the need to carry out euro code design far more regularly. This presented us with a problem due to the design and estimating team being unfamiliar with euro code design. Previously pile design submissions were unclear and hard for clients to follow resulting in numerous query’s coming back for clarification. Design was sent over as multiple attachments in an email summarising the job. Persons involved with pile design attended a 1 day euro code foundation design course run by Thomas Telford, along with a pile design workshop hosted by a Thomas Telford tutor. A full pile design handover pack has been compiled showing the design process, right from the Depth v Cohesion carts up until the final pile schedules for construction. This has greatly reduced the number of design queries finding their way back to JMP."
A number of concrete cube tests were coming back low from the testers. Resulting in having to chase concrete suppliers for batch records. We have arranged for holiday concrete testing to come out to site and give the site personnel a refresher course on making concrete cubes. Also we have bought a new concrete cube making kit for every crew on site.
"Final accounts being hard to close out due to the discrepancy in the number of piles in a secant or Contig wall, usually caused by guide walls being installed at the wrong centres by the ground worker. Now prior to every job that includes a retaining wall starts, we will agree the final number of piles by obtaining a scale AutoCAD drawing and working out the exact numbers to be installed, reducing time spent at the end trying to close the issue out."
"Concrete Agitators going back to the plant suppler with old Concrete cured inside the drum. There is a charge for the Hire company to have to clean the drum. JMP will be buying a Load Cell to weigh the Concrete Agitators when being delivered to every job and picked up from every job to ensure the operative working with the agitator is cleaning out properly. If the Agitator is being picked up heavier that when it was dropped off, JMP staff will clean the drum out reducing any charges."
"Monthly Reports – good quality of information and ensured all we up to date with project. Integrated programmes. Balblair was mentioned as an example when JMS programmer was used to integrate JMS and others programmes into one. This was stopped due to a commercial decision by SSE. Proactive and quick response by JMS to fault situation. Item in general but Mossford issue was mentioned with particular note to the speed of spares sourcing. Availability of planners and detail required on programmes with critical paths. General comment: ‘When you need a planner, you really need one.’ Beauly Mossford highlighted that planner resource was an issue and that the lack of management checks (quality/design) would have been beneficial. Way leave. The contentious issue of way leaves was highlighted as a negative due to the difficulty in commencing the mobilisation of a contract prior to way leaves being in place. Balblair used as an example which has cost SSE a lot of money and is still on going. Mobilising to site early at SSE request lead to standing time for the mobilised team due to construction / detailed design not being turned around in sufficient detail to allow full construction. Programme changes to other contractor programmes has an impact on Murphy programme which has, on Balblair, caused timeframes to be compacted thus resourcing of additional resource and increasing cost. Ensure template is utilised on all framework projects. Template should be to allow further improvement and adjustment to suit project specific requirements. SSE should be responsible for overall planning with regards to contractor interface dates for outages, UG to OHL etc. Murphy to provided programmes in sufficient detail on monthly basis. Murphy can provide assistance with planning of complicated interfaces. Review spares strategy on all new projects with SSE to enable quick turnaround should the same problem be encountered in the future. Review planning resource for SSE framework and time allocation to each individual project. More detailed programme P6 with critical paths for future jobs. Ensure all way leaves are signed prior to issuing of contract / agreeing access to site date. Ensure sufficient time scales are allowed for design. Murphy should not mobilise to site until ready to do so and likewise, SSE should not apply pressure to do same due to fear of not achieving its own programme dates. SSE to understand that constant changes to other contractor programmes has an impact on Murphy. Murphy to raise concern to SSE should resourcing become critical and raise warning instead of pressing forward in order to satisfy SSE requirements. This has proved to allow Quality to suffer."
"Dave Joy (SSE) requested an ITP review meeting to align a process with SSE/JMS. Rory confirmed and agreed that there would be discussions on hold points for Data pack A in particular with a need for clarity on:  Type testing  TQ process (after stage 1 – meeting to finalise). Hold points required in programme for client test witnessing. Poor management of change control, failure to capture changes in specification to NGTS, site staff unaware of company procedures (no regular technical staff on site). Rory agreed to up rev internal change control to improve on the items above. Meeting to be held with Murphy & SSE to go through the current project ITP formats and to develop further to meet both Murphy & SSE requirements on the framework. In house workshop to be held with all Murphy staff working on the SSE framework to ensure they full understand the SSE specifications along with the requirements of NGTS.Site set-up A number of +ve’s with regards the JMS yard set up and welfare facilities. In particular the canteen with full time cook for the workforce as this reduces traffic for work vans etc in villages. It was highlighted that these areas are well thought out prior to installation. This has been implement on the last two projects for SSE and also used as best practise. We need to ensure we continue to drive this on all projects within and outside the framework."
"Design team Good design team but require more and site based. Additional design / technical personnel on site. Rory Davidson confirmed that there was a resource issue within the industry for competent and experienced technical personnel. Dave Joy (SSE) confirmed SSE had a similar issue. Drawings not being followed; technical personnel would identify if on site and carrying out quality checks. Design change Highlighted that JMS were ‘lax’ in following protocol for design changes. Defects raised due to this. Resource As above, a number or remarks on the lack of engineering support on site and ground level. Sympathy from SSE to contract team but internal issue within Murphy. One remark: ‘more and contracts, require more engineers in Scotland from contractor’. Design Risk Assessment Dave Joy (SSE) confirmed this was being reviewed to agree a common understanding of what was required. A further meeting to be planned. Whilst the design team contribute a great deal, more emphasis is required on day to day delivery and the recruitment of additional cable engineering is required. Proceed with requirement of additional cable engineering. Review process and ensure that ALL staff follow the existing process. Proceed with requirement of additional cable engineering. Murphy need to ensure that it is undertaking sufficient design risk management step. This should be captured from outline design (Part A) right through to commissioning and should be used a live document and reviewed at regular intervals to ensure we design out as much risk as practicable."
Murphy to review internal appointment or use of a small number of preferable suppliers.
Contractor using own plant so no issues. Distance from England base Difficulty in getting fitter for servicing. Local service companies being used. Ensure we maintain standards of P&T and review the use of external supplied equipment to ensure we provide both service and value for money to SSE. Review service coverage with expansion in Scotland and the best way to support the projects.
Drum handling Planning and execution of challenging Mossford drum handling to section 3 and 4 especially. Materials Lead time for some key materials caused programme issues. Purchasing process slow internally within JMS. Capture good practise from the project i.e temporary storage locations at pulling positions. Important for all to understand the lead time on supply for cable and accessories. This has a major impact on programme especially with tight outage dates. Process recently amalgamated to one regional office. Procedures and guidelines issued to all staff to ensure a smooth process. This should be dealt with at the start of the project i.e. Data package production should allow a drawdown of all materials that need to be procured.
"Scaffolding to an excellent standard. Quality of work within Beauly Sub Station. Authorisation process of subcontractors within SSE. There is a lack of understanding from SSE on what is required from SSE for a subcontractor to be authorised. There is a need for a detailed process going forward. Fencing contractor Beauly Mossford / Balblair. Particular issue with contractor forced to use by landowner for erection of fencing. Contractor was almost impossible to get a hold of and agree works. Repeatedly wasting all levels of contract team’s time. Agreements like this need to be avoided in future and way leave team should be instructed as such. Ensure continued use of preferred contractors and ensure early engagement to allow design to be done upfront. Following the review it is noted that SSE do not dictate a list of preferred/approved contractors. It is Murphy responsibility to appoint, vet and select contractors based on the competence and experience. They should then be notified to SSE as contractor as per the NEC contract. SSE have the right to reject a contractor. This is an issue not just on SSE projects and is often a necessary evil to ensure land owner / tenant farms do not cause problems for both Murphy & SSE. This would need a joined up approach to successful manage this key stackholder."
"contract is good. What does JMS think? James Rattenbury (JMS) highlighted that the framework was a key part of the strategy for JMS going forward and looked forward to learning from the experiences learned in the contracts so far going forward. ‘Foresight’ would be a good thing on this occasion but you can’t look back, only forwards. Dave Joy (SSE) agreed. Monthly contract review meeting Elgin Dave Joy (SSE) highlighted the excellent meeting in Eglin for the diversion works and was very impressed with the detail of discussion. Payment of invoice from client At time of meeting there was a number of outstanding invoiced and agreed amounts not paid (circa £854,000). These have been awaiting payment for some time. Pre-construction handover meeting. JMS need to chair a hand-over meeting pre-construction to make all SSE/JMS staff aware of the roles of all staff involved in the project and their responsibilities. Both Murphy & SSE need to work together to build relationships and client contractor trust to ensure a long and successful working. Monthly Framework meetings, one to ones with key stakeholders from each business. Need to remain focused and continue to developed design / drawings in line with SSE expectations. Dave Joy / Alistair Radbourne (SSE) to be emailed detail to discuss internally. Murphy to review / monitor over coming weeks. Responsibility lies with both SSE & Murphy to ensure a contract start up meeting is held."
"This very lessons learned workshop. A great forum for issues / frustration to be aired honestly and openly between two business who are eager to work together going forward. HVAC testing contractor It was highlighted the improvement to JMS changing the HVAC testing company to KEMA. All parties happy with their appointment and continued use. Construction quality of ducting Rarely any issues within installed ducting systems and good quality from start to finish. Handover records There seems to be some confusion as to what is expected from JMS to SSE for the final handover records. There has been a number of submission before finally accepted as a template going forward. Discussions highlighted that there were no set format from SSE for this. O&M manual SSE highlighted that the O&M manual issued required some tweeking. Earthing installation The earthing of structures has recently fallen to JMS to do although not initially part of the system design. TP ITP not reflecting what is required from 132kV framework. Cable joint bays not being correctly covered with protection tiles. Tiles were installed over the cables only in the joint bay, tiles should cover the complete area of the joint bay. Agreed – Need to maintain the moment and engagement at all business levels. Murphy now have a framework arrangement in place with KEMA and should be utilised whenever possible. Early engagement and securing outage/ testing dates needs to be done early in the project. Need to maintain a high standard and ensure we always aim to improve the working methods. Once completed and accepted, the records complied for Beauly Mossford will form the benchmark standard for records submission. Dave Joy (SSE) & Rory Davidson (Murphy) to agree format and level of detail going forward. It would be beneficial for this to be included as part of the WI at time of contract award to be included in costings, programme and allow sufficient time for detailed design. Murphy to review specifications and ensure ITP’s are reflective of Frameworks specifications and nor generic standards. Greater presence from engineering / design team required on site to monitor works. PM / CM must read the specifications they are working to."
"Safety record JMS are now at over 350,000 man hours on SSE contracts since 2011 with zero harm. Excellent coordination Joint H&S workshops from SSE and JMS on contracts ensuring good / safe working practices. Site set up Canteen use with cook great giving high standard of welfare for workforce (all levels). Dave Joy (SSE) highlighted that may be a link between the site setup/welfare with the zero harm experienced by the JMS team. SEAR’s It is viewed that the SSE SEAR’s system is overkill by many present at session and the return of SOR’s would take a step forward. JMS record of incidents and fantastic welfare were ‘upsetting’ other contractors in general. Ensure continuous engagement with our culture development programme with all levels of the business. Continue the good practices. SSE & Murphy to review processes. Good to hear from JMS point of view but we can only go backwards so effort is being made to avoid complacency and drive home the safety message."
"2 man environmental team in Beauly Mossford and Balblair contracts. This was highlighted as a big positive due to the mix of hillside, farmland and the town of Beauly to ensure no incidents were encountered. Access the site conditions before we start work and continue this monitoring regime on all projects that require it."
"Good teamwork between everyone at all different levels – also demonstrated by good toolbox talks . Management checking in on how works were progressing – they were easy to talk to .Needed more site management (assistant site manager – a JMS site manager or assistant site manager) 2 engineers dropped out (Christian Street) 13th Sept – No PM and then left. Closer to the blockade more site visit with Senior Management – JM, Eugene Jacobs, Fred Green .Things not getting done beforehand, not the right team from the get-go. no site set up (FSS1 Christian St) .No PM on site in September, obstructions in the ground but not communicated back correctly (FSS1, Christian St). Late design led to less planning time, more pressure on CRE/CEM/Managers in producing and approving documentation. Late land access putting pressure on site establishment whilst trying to undertake works. Lack of GI information at Christian Street meaning redesign of piles and pile caps etc. This could have been identified earlier, appreciate land access played its part but NR should have been held more accountable. Core 6 had an established team, no one wanted to be involved in Christian St and pre planning poor there .Communication between outgoing PM and new PM was not good (vague info shared) .we are an operational delivery focused organisation and need to remember that we make and lose money on sites which have continued without interruption all the way through the pandemic, even with WFH it should have been business as usual, but this sadly has not been the case in all areas .The Team rallied round and achieved success."
"Ainscough – very good 100% - light protection eyewear was a challenge due to heavy rain and fog. Not all had PTS, had to get TVP’s .TES2000 P-Way- good, accommodating, knowledgeable, good briefing, only issue was non-insulated tools .Kilnbridge – good briefings and on point, close calls, when asked to do tasks they did, Safety critical staff in place .Murphy Ireland Ltd / TMT – Sub-contracted TMT for MIL – leaving everything to last minute. Poor, landed two decks with 40 mm gap in the decks, Down bolts (1 of 16 missing) None of the bolts tightened. Attitude to delivery was very poor. Some had left well before the job was finished and on the way to the airport. Murphy raised the alarm two weeks before Christmas, we had to give them some of our guys the help them out. They did not seem to have any solutions and put our guys under extreme pressure. We need to challenge better All Task – Good attendance, no problem with them at all. Good support, Bryon Davies – brilliant, knowledgeable, and good experience. They were in attendance throughout."
"3months notice vs 1 week in advance – same results. We operate with request on a four-week notice, when surveying it is hard to build a programme with the right resources. Requests sent in July and not a name shared back until one week before the possession .Need to keep a log of names of who is good etc. You will get labour but not quality. Early notice of who you are going to get would give reassurance to the management team .Not fair changing the resources last minute. Individuals taken from project with only a few days’ notice and had to be replaced by agency who did not know the job (So unfair) .RMF asked to come down from MK, good feedback .Team Force- Uninterested, stands back and don’t do anything. Shout out to Chris and Sergio from TeamForce – very good at CAW6.  Shift hand overs worked ok in the main, but some exceeded their hours due to work pressure (4+ hrs over) .Many agency just single skilled and would only do what it said their role was on their phone."
"Ordering done by only 2 P Cards. Need various trusted people with P Cards. (Covid or off sick) Over ordering – p-cards. 24 extra bags of sharp sand ordered .Hard to resource materials due to lateness of contract, still struggling to source bricks. Prices have gone up. Procurement – one person deals with each site. Not separate contacts for separate plant hire. Materials being left in KT and no-one knows where they are. Change in design left very late .Paul Walker – shout out – thrown in at the deep end and completed everything that was thrown at him .Site team shown the design and had the information – told why the works were happening – you have to move these cables for this reason . esigners not on site, (hard to design from Google earth). Piling on dry docks, never checked what was in the ground .Design changed 22nd Dec (demotivating) .Main beam- concrete in the bottom, had to get broc in and damaged the arches .Dealing with so many stakeholders. London Underground delayed them .We take projects at the last minute here where in other areas that would not happen We need to engage and Work with the P-Way contractors at a lot earlier stage of the project, going forward. My comment is related to the fact that all the Christmas Works did not have Track Sub contractors on board at the start of the project and at the end of the day if we did not then none of the Structures would have been able to have been done. To me this is a lesson that needs to be learnt that the Track Work has the biggest impact on the Structure being able to be removed and replaced. Breakers got off hired and the supervisor thought they were there and had to use smaller ones .Flannery 13t – were rubbish. Couldn’t get bucket out and issues with hydraulic hoses (old machines) change on what we needed – this may be why we got old machines. Action – need to have a fitter on site throughout main blockade. On call fitters not answering the phone. Liv St - RRVs & Trailers – Anthony (Hemel) very good – good communication, very happy. John Hart (shout out from CAW 6 and Liv St) .There should be a fitter on the project through out .RRV’s and trailers. What was asked for and delivered from Golborne and Hemel Hempstead was very good .Every contractor had plant on site and very little room – carnage with the amount of plant on site. Demo plant 20t machines – not even used (contingency plan). 6 cherry pickers (2 x 3 suppliers) – efficiency. Econ MEWPS broken down – no fitter on site, (Flannery fitter on call), Murphy fitters on site for RRVs .Little Murphy plant, hard to find codes to start them. Off hiring of plant-continue charging weeks later. Speedy very poor in off hiring plant. Chasing tower lights and detcoms two days before the blockade. Needs a bigger team .Chasing the design team for Temp Works Design .Turfers at Christian Street worked well .Didn’t get a temp. works design to support the cables .Temp works worked well at Morris Street .Not enough input from constructability at design stage. Only one Temp works coordinator between all projects."
"upervisors all need to be briefed about the works Proper briefing needs to be completed .Needed earlier access to the bridges to get this work done . Shift changeover – 12-hour shifts does not have time to give us a proper handover. Some teams came in earlier to do the hand overs other hand overs lasted 10 minutes. Were the handovers factored into the programme? Some had to work over 13.5 hrs to do the handover .More ground exploration work needed to be done. Batley Homes very accommodating. RRAP 3 miles from works .Morris Street had good prep time. 4Week Lookahead – written on board in office. Useful as everyone knew what to do . Programme worked well – it worked and was achieved .27 piles driven yet no one put a tender in to get the muck away. Had to rely on agency points operator, He did not turn in (6 hrs late) Points operated by individual without the correct in date ticket. Pod Trac helpful with giving one of their Points opps to assist. We need to upskill our own teams and be more self sufficient. Welfare – Go Green and Bio Marsh – let down by these .CAW6 – no accessible toilets - .TSS – problems with delivering cabins and not efficient space in cabins. Door fell off drying room. Christian street-No cabins originally. They arrived in early December. Big problem to source the cabins (ordered in September but due to land issues and changes of plan availability and delivery was compromised) .Cabins had to be single stacked at Christian St. due to Temp works not signed off .Cabins were not sufficient for the amount of people on the projects .Problems with the generator."
"CAW 6 – Yes – few snags. Opportunity works taken and used CAW 6 – Not to rely on TES 2000 to clean up and tidy up site. Get our own machine on to help with this. Shout out to Jamie McMahon. Why as a team do we operate in Silo’s? What is driving this behaviour? So now we have identified this silo mentality let’s make a commitment that this ends, and we remove the barriers. if we don’t remove these we will never improve or move forward .Staff need to be back in the office a minimum of 3 days a week, I believe WFH has impacted our delivery and communication. We are an operational delivery focused organisation and need to remember that we make and lose money on sites which have continued without interruption all the way through the pandemic, even with WFH it should have been business as usual, but this sadly has not been the case in all areas Late closing of roads, blocking walkways, land agreements."
"Always good, Nick and Gavin and Nigel – one phone call away. Production took priority over safety during these works. The feeling from the core teams was many in management and support serviced turned a blind eye to this fact .CDP-Prepossession briefings good but need to include our Supply Chain partners more. More early requests need to be sent for their support by management. Core Teams Lessons learnt was very valuable Sent out and recorded on teams – collated on a form and also uploaded .Site inductions – worked well Need a clearer way of knowing who has been inducted. Coloured wristbands for Day/night shift."
"Good appetite to get the job done, safety compromised .Exclusion zones need to be followed and managed on site .Complete knowledge of the works, and construction methods down to the last dot needs to be the norm. Too late when questions can’t be answered there and then."
"CAW 6 – N/A .Public opening fence to complain to site staff .Public fascinated by what was going on, size of the crane, interacted with some operatives .The team made up a parcel for one family which included a little Murphy van, Hi vis, blue hat and drawing pad. Before Christmas dropped off books and chocolate to Great Ormond Street hospital .One complaint over noise. Liaisons with local residents could have been better. Some living right beside the works were not aware of what was going on, consistent noise above 96 desiples, lights nor positioned away from properties, less. considerations for mothers and babies, refuge bins could not be emptied by blocked roads The police cut off one road for 6 hours (no plan B)."
"Training provided – dumper training etc .All agreed that they had enough training for the tasks they needed to undertake .A lot of supervisors lacking tickets – used to have them but they are expired (track trolly tickets) Core members should have as many tickets as possible and the correct competencies to complete the jobs. No accidents/incidents (some luck was involved here) .Great teamwork in very difficult circumstances. Most went over and above .Apprentices feel they are developing, being supportive, and ask questions."
"Jack, Lisa, Steve, Harry and Kieran – shout out for CAW 6. For supporting Adrian during a pressured time. Good help from Chris Abberley .Huge amount of work completed in a short amount of time Pictures and videos not being used due to lack of PPE requirements. More training will be implemented to make things better. Sometimes perception of a 2D picture portray a negative light. Morris Street and Christian Street worked well together. Good help and teamwork between the two sites .Christian Street up against the wall and had their challenges but still delivered. Payment – SACs – use the normal project learning support people so they know who is who See what can happen for next year – not fair. Payment rates need to be more .PPE requirements – Light eyewear protection slacked during pressures .PPE – maybe PPE slipped during the main possession .Trying to source food for the teams one week before Christmas, food was cold, poor in quality and late arriving. Client has been really happy with the works delivered .Thank you to all staff. Hotels good, minibuses worked well .Sam (Team force) Covid cleaner VG (never stopped) .Not a lot of praise to the lads who delivered the works .On a personal note and regards to Mental Health as a Topic raised by Nick, I as the Track CRE for Murphy's i have been looking after CP6 and CAM Works all leading up to Christmas and also all the Paperwork Issues since and all the CAMS Work going forward and to be honest i am at near breaking point with my workload, but as i am the only one as our Enhancement Track CRE is on Sick at the moment i am now being asked to look at this too at the moment. This to me points that perhaps we need more Track Skill Focused people to relieve the pressure on myself and others but also to help the Company going forward."
The managers on site are very approachable and we feel we could talk to any of them at any point. A comment made that there are many rungs on a ladder and for the core team to give feedback to the Project manager there are too many rungs to go past. Feedback is always considered and listened to. Murphy are a management company we are here to manage support the Supply chain partner specialist. (painters/Carpenters). We discussed that the best way to climb a ladder is a rung at a time -Using their line manager/supervisor We discussed the use of feedback cards and the 212 process that goes on behind the scenes. The team confirmed that feedback cards are submitted actioned upon and then fed back during feedback Fridays. t was discussed that Murphy are a management company who have lost skilled workers and rely on specialist supply chain partners – they mentioned that to upskill and employ direct specialist would improve the Direct delivery.
"Relationship with the supply chain is positive with good communications. The supply chain operatives are excellent, know their jobs and deliver it safely. The Supply chain partners management needed lots of support and where not up to speed with the processes and systems used (examples were given around lost time & NCR’s). Murphy are using more and more supply chain and it is having a negative effect on the company, Murphy have the ‘Murphy way and subbies have no idea’. It was mentioned that the supply chain operatives know their jobs inside out and were very professional .and work safely. This is due to lack of experience working for NWR Murphy helped to educate and familiarise them with the processes with compounds the feeling that Murphy are just there to support / manage. Upskill & employ more specialist so the need to go external decreases & safety increases."
Murphy have been here just to support the specialist / supply chain .The nature of the works is that the labour / resource has as direct labour are not suitable to the works .It’s the nature of the game to be away from home and work life balance is non-existent.
The works being carried out are tried and tested and there has not been any deviation away from these such as crash decks. NWR seem to go for a cheaper way not the safer way- example of tower v’s crash decks were mentioned. Discussions around the next job to alter the scaffolding so the canopy can stay on while painting and reroofing. The site are happy to listen to suggestions if given and acted on where possible / suitable. These discussions are happening with the site manager and supervisor.
"Murphy’s are well known and recognised for the site set up. The team were not aware of any challenges around programme or cost and believed they were on track in regard to finishing on time, even though there were some changes due to design and having to introduce possessions at night which only had a small window of time to complete the works. The site was fully set up before any works commenced meaning we could concentrate on the works being carried out."
Keeping and eye on the ball and concentration levels high comments were we are Rail we are used to finishing works and not knowing where we are going next.
Keep concentration levels high at this critical park of the works .Detailed briefs and supervision.
The team are thinking about different scaffolding methods to increase delivery and quality
"The team had an excellent interface with both the client, rail users & residents- they maintained this by clear and regular communications – letter drops, emails, friendly conversations. The team donated picnic benches to a local school."
People in the team are trying to develop from general operative to team leader/ supervisor but seems to be blocked or not progressed.
The supervisors and managers listen to feedback and are approachable .The supply chain operatives are very professional .The briefs are very detailed .The workforce and public have been kept safe during the delivery. People joining part way through project .Supply chain partner management not fully up to speed with the processes and paperwork needed for the client .Murphy are using too many supply chain partners and need to upskill out own or employ specialist. Short possessions and the direct murphy team having to hang around all night (both sides of the possession. The team have been successful in their delivery and built good relationships with the residents & station master. They did this by good clear communications.
Brendan Mc Neill attended site on numerous occasions Visibility on site of the project management team could be better but they may have been there. The feeling from the team was senior managers should be out on site more. There was more visibility of them after the scaffold incident. From K2 project Murphy management has been visible and they were very helpful. Positive.
"Pod-Trac poorly managed-Core team of around three professionals and the rest of their team blue hats with seemed to have little experience of this type of work. Ballycommon- 10 on site with only three actually doing valuable work. There needs to be a cut off in work between civils and Pee[1]Way. This leads to too many people at the work site at one time which causes a real danger regarding people plant interface. Decisions by QS seem to be made on a financial basis only, i.e. Vertical. Access very good, always ahead of the game but Rope Tec who are not as proactive but £2,000 cheaper and they get the contract. Challenge. Challenge. Learnings."
"Murphy bridge teams very good and know their trade. Positive Good support and effort from Murphy employees of different Positive disciplines and sectors of Murphy .Not good from our supply and labour suppliers where it seems Challenge to be just about numbers and experience is not challenged before they start work. GBR came in with their own staff and were good. Positive .Agency staff walked of the possession because of the way their Challenge supervisor spoke to them .Various plant opps, supervisors and safety critical with the site teams Positive."
"Not as efficient as it should be -slow in materials arriving (Paving Flags etc). GRP panels-8 week turn around even though these should be on site. Request for liquid dye for concrete, got powder dye (cheaper), most of it blew away and a two-week delay for more. There are many loops to jump through in ordering materials. It is frustrating and it is definitely not better engineered. The design of the bridges worked very well as well as the cills To save time and effort using aluminium poles for handrails instead of steel poles would be easier to manoeuvre and quicker to handle. Also having a loading bay on the scaffold would save time and effort in getting materials to the working area. When knocking down abutment walls or removing stones that will have to go back an idea is to number each stone and photograph them beforehand and then place them on pallets when the walls are knocked using a clamshell or selecta grab. We are still accepting fuel tanks with hand pumps instead of electric pumps. Some fuel tanks have openings that are too small for plant to use their fuel pumps. In some pieces of plant fuel almost empty after changeover of shifts. Fitters and operators to make sure all plant is ready for use for the next operator. There was a 1,000-litre bowser promised which would be moved by the RRV/trailers, this didn’t happen, and jerry cans were used to fuel the plant (carried up the steps) on the rail side. A good idea going forward and to save time to have the codes to start each piece of plant on display preferably in that plant on possession and in the cabin as operators may have to operate many different pieces of plant during possessions. The team would be very keen to see the report from the collapsed scaffold incident. Challenge. Positive Idea."
"Should be done with members of the core team involved. There can be too many big jobs on with little time between them and resource spread to accommodate these. Well planned and executed. There were many additional risks at this time including festivals and events and this was all taken into consideration Positive .The sequence of works does not always align with NR 4 hour reporting and the core teams hear this (we are running behind in the orange or red). More use of the land would have helped. It would have been better if the use of the full field was requested in the planning stage, the cabins and toilet facilities were not adequate for the amount of people that were on the possession. Dav-lavs are not ideal for a long-term project. There was also no meeting room in the compoundNo standard Murphy boards in the cabins and signage had to be glued to the cabins instead of using magnetic signage."
"CDP Prepossession briefing valuable. It was suggested that the mind map of the session would be printed off in plotter size and positioned around the site, but it was printed off in A3. Good help from SHES but maybe just a bit less than usual due to the incident investigation."
In general al were happy with the methods used .Having to cut branches on the road side on the first shift could have been avoided with better foresight.
"In general, this was very good and positive especially with all the activities that were going on in this area."
"Members of the team have requested training for dumpers, but they said they were informed that plant opps cannot get these as it is only for Gen. opps."
"No Injuries, .Even with the incident all kept going and pulled together .Everything K2 asked for they got .The project was delivered safely. Materials being off hired too soon (telehandler off hired when there are still lifts to be done) introducing more manual handling .Not enough praise given by management when critical works are complete."
"Communication with local stakeholders - Feedback from local neighbours and businesses was positive. Compound - Good size ad layout of compound allowed noise reduction to residents and ease of access for site team during construction. Access Points - Plenty of access options and storage at the access points. This led to having the equipment needed in plenty of time. Good relations with the maintainer team at site. NR/ JMS collaboration during core works under possession - Void issue was resolved very quickly by effective teamwork. Pre-Core Meeting - Collaboration meeting pre core between the entire team including JMS, NR and Sub Contractor. Relations with the council - For Footpath closures, Drainage works. Lifting points - Girder lifting points were well designed and ensured safe and easier installation. Established good working relationship with the community. Allowed for ease of access and reduction of noise. Allowed us to stay on programme."
Commercial elements not discussed within the lessons learnt session but reviewed within the Project Assurance Review with Nick Fletcher & Nigel Wood held on 18/11/2021.
P-Way - Good PWAY construction and design. Early subcontractor engagement - MI worked well and had smooth design process throughout. Weathering steel was great design success - Overall finished was aesthetically pleasing and low maintenance. Planning and collaboration with council - Early meetings and collaboration with council enabled successful planning application approval. Safe by design - For main installation of works. Using crane and SPMT in tandem worked well. Position of safety on the viaducts have been improved from what was limited safety areas for safe passage on either end of the bridges. GRP Handrail installation – Easy to install on site. Cost saving from flat span compared to infill design - The cost saved from the stats diversions for going with the flat bed bridge deck replacements. Early youth development zone and Warrington council - Frequent meetings and engagement with the stakeholders allowed the project to go ahead as planned without disruption to each other’s programmes to agree implementation strategy. Don’t rely on standard detail - Lead to changes being needed. Don’t rely on standard detail - Lead to changes being needed. Handrail loose - Fixing detail not suitable. Bridge ID plates - Need to be agreed in advance with the RAM. Project on time and well done. Communication throughout allowed smooth design process and great results. All parties are pleased with the final aesthetic of the bridges. Smooth process providing timely responses and keeping things on programme. Safety was kept at a high standard. Feedback to other projects on success of using this GRP handrail design. Finished within budget costs set. Good working relationship and good reputation for JMS/ NR upheld. Delays. Repairs required to fix the handrail in securely. Reordered to correct them and arranged possessions to install them at a later date.
"SHES lessons learnt at the end of this document. Procurement, Murphy Plant included within other comments and sections within the lessons learnt report."
"Compound - Good size ad layout of compound allowed noise reduction to residents and ease of access for site team during construction. Access Points - Plenty of access options and storage at the access points. This led to having the equipment needed in plenty of time. Good relations with the maintainer team at site. NR/ JMS collaboration during core works under possession - Void issue was resolved very quickly by effective teamwork. Sub-Contractor performance Pod Track - Slow delivery and poor performance during core works delivery. Reporting Changes - Last minute changes to reporting caused issues. Tree felling - Required us to have more control and not to have relied on the council. Traffic Management - Very poor the team disappeared whilst the road was closed waiting for the SMPT was awaiting crossing the road. Pre-Core Track access - 3 Towers were erected but none provided any access to the track prior to the core possession. Unidentified Cables - Had to track down 2 unidentified cables. Allowed for ease of access and reduction of noise. Allowed us to stay on programme. Problem solved quickly and efficiently, keeping the works on time. Confusion between Route control, site and report personnel and report recipients. Caused us to have delays as we needed get the tree fellers back to remove more so SPMT could get past. JMS/ NR needed to control the road closure to enable the SMPT to proceed. Caused delays in access. Delays to works whilst waiting for confirmation on what the cables where."
"Biggest challenge was the lack of time for site investigation to inform the design. Even after project completion the team are still finding unknown assets and proving the historic drainage in the area. NR didn’t fully understand their asset – informed they had pipe through the tunnel yet we discovered it was brick culvert. Planning was as good as it could have been in the timescales and considering the pressure NR put the team under. Crick - Evident that lack of planning time afforded by Client filtered through to site team. Perception across many of the site team was that it seemed rushed and felt disorganised. Usual trackway provider couldn’t mobilise at short notice so had to use an untried supplier “Grassform”. Not up to it & resulted in trackway being condemned by SHES. Site setup also felt rushed and not up to usual standards. High volume of aligned feedback around how tired the lads were going straight to Kensal from Crick without going home. Many were demotivated and down at the beginning. Having said that, they worked tirelessly and did a great job across both blockades. Most people fed back that they hadn’t seen anything about the job until they started for their first shift. A site walkout the week before (accesses, layout, the plan etc) or a circulated briefing note, even an induction, would have been really useful. Result was having to familiarise with the site, the accesses and the people at the same time as having to think about the outputs themselves. Could have been removed through a little thought. Some site team members felt we took too much on for delivery within the blockade. Not the drainage specifically but other supplementary items of work that sapped time, effort and resource for little benefit - also had CCTV and jetting, plus a further gang doing catchpit repairs in the tunnel along with the Balfour Beatty drain train. Too much work happening at once meant some of it simply didn’t happen. It was noted that this issue was escalated to management early but it fell on deaf ears. Feedback from SHES that whilst they were available to support during site setup, no one requested assistance. A few proactive visits din advance of or during the cabin setup and trackway works could have avoided the rework issue we experienced. Access ramp from compound down to track was noted to have been constructed differently in future. It was cut too straight and therefore became too steep which created issues for the RRV drivers on & off tracking. With hindsight, it should have been cut more across the slope to reduce the gradient. A&I engagement process to get it done was so involved due to nature of Alpha that it mean A&I planners’ day job stopped. This had a knock-on effect on the planning & integration of other schemes. Lots of stuff didn’t go through the correct planning processes and timescales, importing unnecessary risk. Put a lot of pressure on NR Route people – processes protect people and this sort of approach is where mistakes are made. We understand that is the nature of Alpha, but it felt extreme and unnecessary, even unsafe. Consider different shift pattern and personnel at end of any back-to-back future blockades to enable people to return home and rest before going again. Mandate early engagement of SHES advisors to assist during setup and not after it. Temporary Works design? Was this delivered as per design and if so was the design incorrect? Had the plant ops been engaged with in line with principles of ‘The Last Planner’ process? Appreciate the impact intense planning periods will have on operational and functional personnel’s outputs away from the project at hand and put mitigation in place to prevent other schemes suffering."
"Multiple elements of feedback on the quality of resource we had available. It was noted that of all the earthworks and drainage operatives we have, we only have enough good lads for 2 decent gangs. Hence why we had to use the same lads across back to back blockades. Night shifts didn’t have breaks. Worked 12 hours straight in an attempt to hit planned output as they felt under pressure. Sean McCann handed a burger through the cab window to eat whilst he operated the RRV. Using slings to drop the pipes into the trench (instead of operatives entering the trench or extensive temporary works) worked well and was commented on as a positive by every interviewee. Consider how it will work when using the lighter, more flexible twin-wall pipe rather than the heavier, solid wall pipe used here. Kensal repeatedly criticised for initially being disorganised. First week was “carnage” driven by confusion in the main created by Balfour Beatty. Mark Cowper’s introduction made a big difference to the night shifts in terms of organisation, but it was noted that the lads on the ground suffered from a lack of a leader – Glen McGlasson was there but was pulled into the office far too often. Positive feedback on the Whatsapp group set up for the project to keep the lads updated of information, issues, timings and changes. However not everyone knew about it whilst others did but weren’t added to it which made them feel a little isolated. “Clique culture” referenced. Most people commented on how visitors to site were a significant hindrance. Especially NR, who arrived en masse, and unannounced despite being asked not to. Unplanned inductions etc took people away from their tasks and having to find safety critical staff to escort people around wasn’t ideal. Also many people noted how it was the visitors to site who were placing our people under the most pressure, demanding more output, higher metreage and generation of unnecessary confusion through trying to amend the plan away from something that was evidently working. Multiple comments from operatives that they didn’t appreciate senior management turning up and upsetting “the rhythm” by taking over and shouting orders at people. The operatives who commented would prefer an ‘army[1]style’ chain of command and to constantly liaise with Site manager and Engineer rather than have their communication channels interrupted. It was also noted that the impact of senior visits isn’t always positive. Perception is that senior team only turn up when there’s an issue which drives a negative mindset into the operatives – one that makes them believe they have failed or are failing. Following on from above point, the pressure to increase outputs drove an unhealthy competition between day and night shifts. Most visitors were there on days which directly impacted the approach of the day shift – they felt under pressure to get pipe in the ground so laid as much pipe as possible to get the numbers up but didn’t backfill. This had a detrimental effect on not only the output but also the morale of the nightshift as it created a perception that they were sweeping up after the “glory hunters” on days , but also that the lack of backfilling on days meant the nightshift had no empties to put their muck into. Which further exacerbated the issue and drove a wedge amongst the team. This faux competition also led to too much time wasted walking the job counting metreage over and over. Pipe layers saying one thing and rrv drivers saying another but both always over[1]egged so Site Manager had to repeatedly walk the job and count up to satisfy the never-ending procession of calls from senior management wanting to know how many metres were in the ground.. Printing off SSOW Packs was a massive issue. Site Manager spent 2 full days purely printing out packs for agency staff. All agency COSS’s and CC’s don’t have tablets so the only way we can do it is by printing the packs. Leon R printed over 30 packs with each over 500 pages so took a ridiculous amount of time. Signing in with the ES became a chore due to regular location changes, and cost us time. ES insisted on everyone driving to Willesden Junction which took over an hour each way. However positive in that they realised this wasn’t working and adapted, changing the plan so that the ES travelled to each compound and signed in there. Two site wardens only were appointed to monitor the ALO / SSOW and were expected to do it for 12 hours. This was deemed as too much (commented on by multiple persons) as they needed a break in order to carry out their duties effectively. f you have a tamper in a worksite then it has to have a dedicated COSS. This is something we always forget about. We tend to find ourselves scratching around trying to find a COSS and changing roles around – we don’t learn. On a similar vein, NR arranged to come in and do the sonic testing but didn’t have a COSS with them. They should provide their own safety critical staff? This caused an issue for us. Did we agree to it and no one told the site team, or did NR just assume they could borrow someone from us? Site Manager fed back that he felt people could support more. Stated that he need that bit of assistance, a RH man to help with req’s, paperwork, reporting, records etc. A sub-agent or Asst Site Manager. The only person who came to site who actually helped was Tom Platt. But we shouldn’t be relying on SHES staff to deliver operational outputs like paperwork etc. Even little things like the job number changed three times but no one said anything so requisitions and the like were being rejected by (say) MPL which resulted in confusion and rework. Succession planning and information transfer to ensure tomorrows Gangers and Foreman are mentored by these ‘good lads’. A proposal came from an interview that everyone should just stop for 30 mins and have 1 break together – staggered breaks don’t work as you need the machines, labourers, pipe layers etc all. using the lighter, more flexible twin-wall pipe rather than the heavier, solid wall pipe used here. Consolidate the method, perhaps produce a crib sheet around best practice and circulate amongst personnel likely to lay pipe in drainage. Ensure everyone is included in initiatives such as this as can be counter-productive to morale if people are left out. Visits are either planned and accepted, or they don’t go ahead. Clear communication in advance and site teams to stick to it with full backing from senior team. Communication channels to be respected and the hierarchy followed to ensure instructions are clear and consistent. Communicate to all future shifts that pipe metreage only counts once it is fully backfilled with both pea gravel and ballast. Wider strategy required to engage with agencies and improve tablet accessibility. Liaise with Mike Healey and Ste Matthews to understand when On Track will be turning off the ability to print packs out. Consider adoption of a similar plan for future blockades. Should have had 4 on rotation so they could concentrate better. Consider how we will manage this in future and consider appointment of a COSS for these duties. Consider Asst Site Manager role to support site managers and generate succession planning."
"Balfour Beatty (BB) being the lead and having priority caused numerous issues for us. We lost approaching two shifts at the start of Kensal due to BB. NR then put pressure on us to change the plan and add more resource to recover the lost time. Confusion around the interface between NR, JMS and BB, specifically around who was doing what. During planning phase, we were a standalone worksite but then Alpha got involved and quickly we were downgraded to working under BB. BB loaded ore and more interventions / workgroups into the blockade and it quickly became unmanageable. OCR had some works to do but were kicked out to make way for BB’s ever-growing list of works to deliver. Perception that the increased scope and volume of work fronts coupled with the lack of time available for planning and integration made it unsafe. It could be argued that JMS losing c20 hours at the start of the blockade was a direct result of this. BB were supposed to provide train loaders, but didn’t which meant we had to source our own ‘on the hoof’. Another example of the lack of planning & appropriate integration resulting in communication issues. Final example was that we were informed BB would bring the trains into the worksites and would produce the ‘Certificate of Readiness’ for the trains upon completion, but didn’t and we ended up doing it all. Potentially a double issue in the amount of ballast we ordered to come on the engineering trains. Over-ordered, meaning we had to offload it before we could start digging. At Crick especially, this was evident and we underestimated how long it would take to unload the trains, meaning we lost a significant amount of time. Consistent feedback about how regularly the plan changed. However the changes were not communicated properly. It was noted how the change to the programme on the last shift became a significant issue. PM arrived and instructed a change & compliance with a new programme, but the works were already complete. Lots of negative feedback received on the split shift pattern. People felt like it didn’t work well, provided no benefit. Didn’t align to trains so staff were having to wait to commence works. They kept changing and people started off on 7-7 which moved to 6-6 and then 5-5. It was accepted that the shifts had to flex with the programme and its delays, but the amount of change was deemed excessive and unhelpful. Also noted that breaks were either erratic or non-existent and that didn’t land well with operatives. Engage with RRV drivers during the design & planning stages (principles of ‘The Last Planner’) to ensure our programme durations and volumes / sequence of materials of material arriving via train are realistic. Earlier engagement with Foreman & RRV drivers to ensure the correct train configuration is planned and ordered, especially in light of getting the configuration right for the upcoming blockade. Thoroughly consider which RRV’s will be carrying out which duties and request the most appropriate one with consultation from our experienced RRV drivers. Training and / or briefing on how to correctly and adequately load train wagons to be organised for CC’s, RRV drivers and supervisors asap. We need to treat supply chain as Murphy employees and brief / engage / manage / supervise them in exactly the same way as we do for our own works as they are representing our business. Also ensure supplier feedback is captured by procurement and we follow up on poor performance by these suppliers formally."
"Trains came with the wrong configuration at Crick. Pea gravel, ballast and empties in the wrong order, and not enough empties. Created a fair amount of lost time and was only resolved by splitting the train. Feedback from Mal Dickinson was that this is how the trains were ordered. Estimated by Mark Cowper that we lost c2 hours per train due to the incorrect configuration, which adds up over the course of the blockade. Concern that we are now doinjg the same thing for the upcoming blockades. Numerous plant breakdowns were referenced by many of those interviewed. Can’t really be helped and is mitigated by having fitters on site, and the likes of Pirtek on call. Good use of RRV’s too – not too many and the right ones generally used. It was noted that a 2nd Mecalac would have been a better back up machine than a 2nd bug. One comment made that the tight gauge meant the Liebherr can’t fully slew which meant we essentially lost the use of one RRV. This became an issue when tidying the loaded train wagons up. Multiple pieces of feedback about RRV drivers not being able to correctly load a wagon. Not understanding what constitutes a full wagon i.e. weight rather than volume. Also resulted in spoil falling off onto the track below which took more time to clean up. We are inconsistent because its solely on the knowledge and skill of the drivers, and obviously some are better than others. Source of friction between drivers, CC’s, E/S and train loader and must be addressed. The last shift had a plan that none of the train wagons would be loaded after 18:00. But people were still loading and ignoring the plan after that time. Had a lot to do to get rid of the trains and bring in the tamper, which meant we had to wait and lost another 90 minutes. First train leaving delayed by half an hour due to an incident at Wembley which had a knock-on effect. Not enough time allowance in the programme for checking the trains over prior to departure and completing all the necessary checks and paperwork. We never make allowance for the amount of time it takes, and our people but especially RRV drivers need to get better awareness of the impact overloaded wagons or pieces of pipe sticking up can have if they are missed during the checking process. Feedback on our supply chain partners – Pro Rail and Podtrack – was consistently negative. Both were regularly referenced as ‘rough’ and not up to JMS standard. It was noted by one person that our management and supervision of PodTrack was very poor. We left them to it (common theme with our supply chain) and allowed them to be completely self-sufficient as they were using a dedicated access etc. Our supervision would have meant their works were of a better quality, were much tidier upon completion and perhaps they wouldn’t have hit the cable. Pro Rail were noted as regularly hitting the OHLE, rough & ready and generally poor to the point we had to tell them what to do and how to do it. Was also noted that their lift plans (submitted in advance) were also poor They also left the outfall (UTX) out which meant they had to over-pump – not experienced drainage installers. JMS SHES staff had to spend a lot of time reminding them about exclusion zones etc. Some of their supervisors were good, some were awful. Lots of language barriers, overcome by interpreters but created confusion. Noted by another op that they got in the way and held our works up. Dan Collins fed back that their engineer hadn’t been briefed in advance and knew nothing about the scope, engineering assurance or handback requirements when he arrived on site. A Pro Rail positive was witness in that they had a speaker system set up in the RRV cab which negated the requirement for dect comms. Made it easy to use as when speaking to the CC the driver could hear too. Earlier engagement with Foreman & RRV drivers to ensure the correct train configuration is planned and ordered, especially in light of getting the configuration right for the upcoming blockade. Thoroughly consider which RRV’s will be carrying out which duties and request the most appropriate one with consultation from our experienced RRV drivers. Training and / or briefing on how to correctly and adequately load train wagons to be organised for CC’s, RRV drivers and supervisors asap. We need to treat supply chain as Murphy employees and brief / engage / manage / supervise them in exactly the same way as we do for our own works as they are representing our business. Also ensure supplier feedback is captured by procurement and we follow up on poor performance by these suppliers formally."
"Numerous operatives reference the dig levels being made shallower during the Blockade, but none of them could articulate why. They felt it was because it was decided it was too deep and could just be brought up. However, conversations with CRE and CEM determined the reasons for this – that there was a dip in the track at the UB’s and the drainage depth had to account for this. Secondly, when surveys were undertaken we only took a level on the 6ft rail and didn’t pick up top of sleeper or 6ft ballast level. So the design stated it was a 1.5m dig but that was from top of rail – actual dig was more like 1.2m. To keep it shallow we had to put a non-compliant UTX in with a separate F002/003 design. However, it was noted by the CRE that we wanted to reuse pipe leftover from Lea Green and due to its design, this particular pipe had to go in at a certain depth. There were 10kVa cables present less than 2m from our dig yet we didn’t know they were there and missed them by pure luck. One operative gave feedback that we need to explore alternative options for digging straight into the train when installing 6ft drainage. This would avoid double handling and excessive travelling time with RRV’s – manageable trench supports or something outside the box to enable train to straddle the dig would be fantastic innovation. Only one Temporary Works Supervisor appointed to cover Murphy works, Pro Rail works and PodTrack works. Resulted in this person running up and down between suppliers carrying out checks and supervising works. Topo surveys should pick up specific data required to formulate an accurate and efficient design. Explore this further! Consider findings from Primrose Hill project and why we didn’t carry out full buried services scan during the design. Consider exploring with MAE if not already done. Consider appropriate resource in future, or wider use of site engineers or suppliers’ personnel in this capacity."
"Lack of suitable experienced site staff including an agent, TWC and engineers led to poor management on site in identifying and resolving issues, ultimately resulting in delays & overspend.

"The lack of early focus on the areas to be remediated meant that the extent of surveys (and de-vegetation) was much greater than necessary leading to unnecessary vegetation clearance (and subsequent replanting) and lack of detail in surveys.

"The lagoon situated on the South side of Great Rocks Tunnel had very limited access. SEP suggested using a drone to obtain footage of the lagoon and dye test the drains from the tunnel to see where it was flowing to. Any issues arose throughout the duration of the survey’s were flagged up straight and communication was good between JMS and SEP. All Shift Reports and Early Warnings were sent through in good timing. Good team work and dedication from the site team, particularly with the location of the site, signal issues and weather etc. GPS Signal caused issues with the Topographical Survey. A change in methodology was made allowing the Survey to be carried out with just one additional shift. The missing information from the Topographical Survey was picked up quickly and used just one additional shift. It was identified that CEMEX are pumping too much into the drainage system (over what has previously been agreed with Network Rail). JMS are therefore installing a Flow Meter to monitor what they are pumping in. Flow Meter is being installed in Weeks 24 and 25 by JMS. Good communication and planning between JMS and Tarmac allowed us to gain access through their yard and down to track at Great Rocks Tunnel. Consider using a drone for future works where access is limited."
"The entire worksite was split down into four smaller areas and a priority list provided of the order in which surveys should be carried out. This was not followed through as it should have done, poor communication. The water levels on site caused huge issues for the drainage team, due to the calcite in the drains. The ground conditions one site was worse than anticipated due to the calcite building up. There was a change in methodology required in the Topographical Survey due to the signal issued on site. CEMEX are over-pumping into the existing drainage system. It is being poorly maintained and it is possible that existing agreements are not being met. There were issues with access due to one of the access points being out of use. When we were lead, on possessions the ES had further to travel to set out the Marker Boards. This ate into the shift and possessions times some weekends. There was an issue with the SWP on the first shift, due to the Sidings not being included. There is still some missing information on the Topographical Survey. The retaining walls are not included and so the space between the track and the retaining wall cannot be considered by the designers. Going forward, any issues with signal etc. should be raised to JMS as early as possible to enable us to assist as much as we can. Network Rail have been made aware and Flow Meter is being installed by JMS in Weeks 24 and 25. N/a. Good communication with the planner going forwarded resulted in the packs being down grade allowing us to take possession of the Sidings each week. Further visit is required to record the missing information to allow the designers to move forward with the design for the channels."

Online induction completed beforehand reduced issues (over 200 people inducted prior to core). Positive."
6F5 deliveries had a lot of fines – sandstone .Noted with supplier. Eziklamp GRP handrailing comes with GRP fittings – slow process to fabricate Rail Live Seminar had steel fittings – quicker process .Needs looking into to see if it could procured / complies with NR. Marwoods provided softwood skids instead of hardwood. Supplier apologized.
"Gap between bridge decks left a trip hazard. Plate fabricated to cover it by Kev McLoughlin. Plinths Sizes need to be 100mm bigger than bearing to allow timber shutters to fit around them Allows joiners to fit shutters before core possession .Further notice to designers. Approach units to be at same level as bridge decks More aesthetically pleasing to the eye with better alignment of handrailing/kickboard. Further notice to designers. Following breakout of cills (too much) can leave voids underneath approach units that need retention Difficult to manage breakdown with large breakers. JMS Telehandler broke down at start of core Replaced by Foundry & Bewsey telehandler JMS telehandler replaced a hired in plant. Grout Pump & Spare fuel bowser (with hand pump) arrived late. Hand pump bowsers should be removed off plant list. JMS fitter not allowed work on Flannery machines. Have 2no. fitters for every shift (JMS & Flannery). Keys & codes hard to find prior to core. Key list with codes needs to be on site for core. On certain excavators, the pipes for the breakers are too short .Need’s checking upon delivery when used the arm of the excavators on the side. Selector Grab on excavator very useful for removing large items .Positive. Can plant checks be done to the on ipads (TXM use QR codes). Reduced temp works on access by lifting bridge deck into compound instead of driving Positive Reduced temp works on access by lifting bridge deck into compound instead of driving. Positive. Late information provided for wagon/trailer spec on bridge deck delivery made it a rushed temp works install. Transport needs to be better with communication. Edge Protection needs to be looked at for wagons when offloading units. Mobile scaffold units? Speak to precast suppliers going forward."
"Various surveys of on-track cables prior to site start Additional slack added to all cables made cable slewing an easy task .Positive. Road drainage survey undertaken prior to project start to assess council drainage. TTRO would need 12months advance notice if possible, for main works. Programme reduced by 1.5weeks by NR due to budget constraints. Well planned & executed plan – weather conditions went well too .Positive. Correct number of possessions requested, 2/3no. cancelled. Positive. Site Compound should be bigger, reduced as part of agreed NR contract Potentially increase compound to take car park Murphy seen to be weak with challenged by NR “The only thing we can change in a project is the compound” – site team. Site Welfare Setup very good Briefing Room as entry point 32 Ft cabins are good Courtyards & Canopy’s in place. Positive. Good relationship with landowner – very willing/helpful . Positive. Access road for landowner worked well/little inconvenience Positive."
2no. Staircases to ease access to bridge scaffold. Positive. Good SHES support – Fiona Clarke & Tom Platt assisted throughout. Positive. Good CPD Support – John Moore & Gaz Riding on site numerous times. John also helped in core possession. Positive. Pre-possession core possession very helpful .Positive. Very little blue hats visible over the core possession .Positive.
"Loading Bay on scaffold could have been useful. Increase size of plinth to allow formwork. McCulloch TRT for moving rail - very impressive kit. Allows for simultaneous activities on track, safer & time efficient Timbling/dragging rail avoided with RRV. Palletising the large masonry blocks. Building track panels in site compound, reduced crane movements during core. Consider next time in temp works over roads. Consider for further projects. Consider for further projects. Consider for further projects when time is available. Consider for further projects."
Extremely good landowner – communicates daily with site team .Positive. Local neighbours generally positive on the site works/bridge replacement. Have enjoyed the road closure/quiet period .Positive. No robberies/trespassing. Positive. Initial road closure signage wasn’t detailed enough and referencing local business still open. Positive. JMS to provide all local houses with a photo framed aerial photograph of the compound during the core possession thanking them .Positive.
"Harness Training completed on site prior to core. Positive .More vehicle/plant Banksperson needed for cores .Regular review of each person competencies needed (some run out without notice. Familiarisation of plant items needs to be done with plant Op’s at shift changeovers. TRT & Gecko plant items very effective. Positive. Removing spoil onto road & embankment during core – efficient use of time (Grab Wagons to remove then) .Positive. Removing spoil onto road & embankment during core – efficient use of time (Grab Wagons to remove then) .Positive. Track Panels fabricated in compound prior to core. Positive.

The time constraints of the core possessions – AFC’s aren’t signed off until we are on site but yet core possession time is booked 12/24 months out. Core Possession Programmes can differ in methodology based on site circumstances during core which means we not complete tasks to the 4 hourly reports in correct order – can lead to programme falling behind/ going yellow or red with progress still being made. No storage area trackside in cess for storing small plant and materials. No trial erection given the size of bridge elements. Made it technically more challenging for engineers. JMS to consider. Further discussions with NR.
"Significant resourcing issues including lack of an agent, changes in TWC and lack of an experienced engineer led to difficulties in identifying setting out/design issues, resolving site issues and tracking progress/quantities. Critical review of available resources required prior to commencement including ensuring key staff appointments made sufficiently early. Role of TWC has increasing important in latest standards updates. Original method for regrade / 6G placement could not be achieved. Money spent on Temporary slope stability on a method which was unachievable. Full review of methodology to be carried out in advance to ensure achievable. Original method for regrade / 6G placement could not be achieved. Money spent on Temporary slope stability on a method which was unachievable. Full review of methodology to be carried out in advance to ensure achievable. Unauthorised Cutting down of trees within 3rd party land, to facilitate works, resulting in heavy costs. Clear understanding with delivery team of requirements to facilitate works and better communications of what had been agreed during Land Access discussions. Level Crossing managed very well. Early engagement with the NR Level Crossing Manager (Tom Paget) for the region. Carful planning and management development. Insufficient handover from departing Site Agent to Engineer and management team. Unsure on materials ordered and or testing regimes. Engineer had to spent a lot of time obtaining info. Ensure future departing staff, carryout a full and concise handover. Leaving the team with all relevant information to proceed with the project. Following early issues, the relationship with the land owner was managed well on site, good involvement and communications of all items of work that had potential to cause disruption."
"Issues with tracking quantities used/billed led to unexpected cost over-run. Better resourcing with provision of an agent and more experienced engineering support would have identified issues sooner. Review of Murphy systems for tracking supply against orders required to address reconciliation issues. Now keep labour, plant and material tracker which commercial go through with site managers on weekly basis. Minor due to quantities but cost at PTC for aggregate increased by contract award. Ensure either captured within the risk pot or as an assumption/clarification. Late applications from s/c and items added to s/c work scope that were not passed on or picked up by .QS Pressure to be placed on S/C to provide regular AFPs. Process to be followed when apportioning works. NR slow in responding to Programme updates, EWN, CE and CE quote due to change in PM. Commercial meeting held once every 2 weeks but still not being addressed. Murphy to raise GC on CEMAR to record all delays."
"Topo survey – 1) Specification not detailed enough 2) Topo survey not checked by designers until too late 3) Topo mistakes due to Deveg/access issue 4) Topo scope was based on the class of scheme - refurbishment These led to repeat visits on Bradfield Topo should be firmly in designer’s scope and where possible undertaken by them to avoid any debate about responsibilities for inaccuracy/coverage Opportunities for using LiDAR data (validated by topo) should be considered to improve coverage. The cost cutting process that happened at the start of CP6 – using the cheapest framework designer, agreeing a minimal design scope – is the root cause of the engineering issues that occur during GRIP 5 and GRIP 6-8 with WSP. Adequate earthworks design and construction process (see guide developed by CAM). The cost cutting process that happened at the start of CP6 – using the cheapest framework designer, agreeing a minimal design scope – is the root cause of the engineering issues that occur during GRIP 5 and GRIP 6-8 with WSP. Adequate earthworks design and construction process (see guide developed by CAM). Use of design review log was not introduced until later on design process. Design actions/decisions/reviews were recorded via Aconex mail, design review forms, workshop minutes, and presentations. The benefits of the DRL have been demonstrated on later schemes in the earthworks portfolio. Use of the DRL – to be managed by the design manager but reviewed by the CEM/CRE-C. Ensure adequate designer input. Inexperienced site staff were unable to identify and resolve issues with the proposed elevation leading to delays and a sub-optimal toe wall elevation (unnecessarily high). Better resourcing with provision of an agent and more experienced engineering support would have identified & resolved issues sooner. Early setting out/checking by site team to identify potential issues. Ensuring engagement of a more proactive designer would have ensured that potential issues with the elevation were highlighted and allow better focus of Murphy engineering review to pick up potential issues. Late identification of the need for monitoring platforms at cess level resulting in temporary works design change. Early review by TWC to identify and agree temporary works. Projectwise Murphy no longer involved in the Projectwise workflows, due to conflict between use of Aconex and Projectwise. As-builts from WSP Engage a more collaborative and pro- active designer. Also add in guidance on Y01s and Z01s on the FEMP (currently under review). Over dig caused by site team trying to form benches in loose granular material. Review Drawing notes, do not form benches within loose material, simply placed fill material without the need for benches."
Lack of TWs co-ordination. Causing delays in design and inappropriate management of the .TWs Early appointment of Agent and suitably experience TWC. NCR raised for Gabion batter. Setting out to be check prior to install and then prior to placement of further Gabions. No project specific reference raised on Airsweb Ensure add at project outset by SHES team. Good management of Consents & Environmental. No Accidents/Incidents but safety tours to be picked up. Ensure regular Simple Action tours carried out.
"Brendan McNeill was hands on throughout the project and led from the front .Danny O Brien was out twice during the blockade and engaged with all. The core team really appreciated this as it meant a lot to them .Good visibility of the PM during the blockade .A lot of pressure on the site manager which could be averted if admin that could have been done in the main office was done there It would also help if there was admin support on the blockade which could take care of logging close calls, filing etc. instead of eating into the site manager’s time. Very good interactions with site manager which helped the supervisors understanding how to use the tablets."
"Pod Trac need to be more transparent with their time/Plan as these did not match up with Murphy timescales and plans (disjointed). Senior Murphy management stopping GBR to undertake any work for Murphy within two weeks out, putting the site team under pressure to be fit to start . Earlier interactions around the table with our Supply Chain Partners would help. Pod trac got the job 3 weeks before the start of the blockade. O Neill &Bryan agency- One operative tried to double shift and clear this with a phone call, another rang Saturday morning saying “he overslept but did not come in” Ballycommon staff were not good. The Saturday night shift saw staff turn up at different times, and not demonstrating the will to work, taking excessive breaks and leaving early. Water seal were every good, very helpful which allowed the Murphy team to change the design based on their feedback Alba- very good MGF- very good Tree fellers-very good Tera Ferma-poor, they recommend 4 fixings where Murphy request 6 per matting. The team then came with insufficient fixings and expected the project site teams to make the decisions on the day. This needs to be mandated further up the management chain so this issue is resolved before Tera ferma arrive on site. Kim Wiseman is going to speak to Daire Murphy on this challenge Ainscough- very good and helpful throughout Attridge scaffolders- very good."
"Planning could have been better i.e. Sat night-Podtrac admitted to having a poor labour show. They mentioned they were blinkered by the task (getting the track out quick and getting the track in quick) whilst missing the details. There should be more transparency and our management should have taken a more active role to ensure both parties were on the same page Pod trac core team were very good but 3rd party staff and supervision poor .Great skill set with Earthworks and structures working closely together. There is a challenge as the project nears the end of the works. The job is being stripped of people who have full knowledge of the job and replaced with people who have no knowledge .There was no one actually assigned to operate the telehandler. Fortunately, there were people (supervisors) with the ticket on the project."
"Very difficult, if suppliers do not have what have been ordered they are slow in letting the project know, sometimes the items do not get delivered but they are down on the delivery note .Because the suppliers could not print small print on one poster this affected the delivery of over 200 signs for weeks. 6 weeks into the job they started to put the signage up .It is a full-time job keeping track of deliveries as they come in dribs and drabs .Supply terrible from ARCO and EHM.5 VJT-VG. If the items are not in stock, they will give the site a clear delivery date. Units could have had rubberised gaskets attached before they arrived on site (took up a lot of time). There needed to be a proven method of water sealing. Mammal shelf- decisions are still been made. Fixings, shelf could have been predone removing Havs and working in challenging conditions .The landing slabs worked very well. Culvert pullers worked very well .Remote controlled whackers had good compaction and seperated people from plant .MacCulloch track lifters worked very well and saved a lot of time (first time they have lifted this size panel, set up by GBR methology). It was noted that some of the double stacked pads (Tera Ferma) were loose and a hazard, so the team removed these .Temp work good .Inscaptulation had a bar running right through the centre of the tent for running fixed lanyard .Zap shelter very good . Beside is an example of better design when constructing the next one. This should also be built as part of the compound set up. This at the moment has to be erected and de- erected by Zap as we do not have anyone with a level 3."
"It suffered badly by late delays of materials from our suppliers (PPE, Signage for example) .Good size site and well utilised. Very good planning meant time was gained earlier in the blockade which compensated for the effects of the poor weather later on. TSS-no seal on drying room doors, doors had holes in them, and cabin was not double skinned or insulated .Office cabins should come with all the right materials and signage boards. TSS slow to respond to issues Microwave reported one week before possession replaced 4/11/2021."
Very good support from SHES and also Kim Wiseman. Early engagement took a lot of pressure off during the core. CDP. Valuable site visits at an early stage. The prepossession briefing was very good as were the mind maps. This Core Teams lessons learnt is a great tool for all to learn and get better. Going forward more subbies need to get involved in this.
The QRSA had to be run a few times and the planning worked very well with many involved.
No challenges here .Very good interactions between all the teams.
"Good to have Murphy people working together and aligned with the Murphy values. Having a few days available before the blockade to understand how the culvert segments fit together was good because it allowed for the installation of these to run smoothly .Selecta Grabs should be used on every possession as it takes the second person out of the working area of the plant .Electronic packs were very beneficial, allowed the SWP to be approved ahead of possession and easier for the person controlling the packs to monitor and review."
"What the team achieved in the timescale with weather conditions, followed all instructions and also Earthworks and the Structures team coming together to deliver a very complex piece of work. The weather."
Tenanted space under bridge structure not accessible during design stage. Early occupation of tenanted space to enable design verification surveys. Slow response from Tower Hamlets and Tarling West Housing Association. Early engagement of stakeholders. Several meetings held on site. Presentations on virtual meetings. Kept residents informed through letters. Opportunities for giving back to the community to be agreed early in the programme. Dealing with DLR - Decisions not made early enough Engaged DLR early regarding asset protection agreements. Competent CRE to lead technical matters. Working adjacent the DLR- J Murphy have no competence to work. Train operatives for DLR competences. Very tight programme. Delays in getting GS6-7 contract signed. Early contractor involvement issued for all long lead items such as steel procurement and bearings. Land Access issues - Dealt with the wrong stakeholder for several months. Commence land access meetings with client at least 18 months before works commence Verify project is dealing with correct landowner. Resource allocation TWC/CRE roles need to be separated for large schemes. Right level of resource to be considered at tender stage.
"Forecasting – costs landing late (plant, hotel bills, materials etc.) Site to site transfers not efficient Challenge plant department and escalate asap PCARD costs received late, engage procurement department to expedite. Early visibility of Labour, plant, and materials costs. Commercial to be copied into labour, materials requests Regular meetings with delivery team. Cost transfers for early instructions Programme Contract on time. Risk allowance not adequate or missing from register Adequate allowance for critical items such as asset condition, uncharted services, dealing with residents. Forecasting at each GRIP stage. Commercial to have regular reviews with the delivery team for all GRIP stages. PCARD payments for communications Involve Communications & Stakeholder .Manager during estimation and forecasting processes."
"Late instructions for GS3&4 optioneering stage 513 Issues. To challenge client as it could have been more efficient to replace both 512&512 at the same time. EWN sent to client, but instruction not effectively managed early enough during GS3/4. Engage RAM and Asset Engineer early in the process. Escalate to senior management if no responses are received. Engaged Harrisons Engineering early in design stage to. Adjacent DLR Interface detail between structures. Limited information. Detail required to ensure decks acted independently .CRT assessment management plans to be implemented on time to enable intrusive surveys required for design development. Additional defects identified at a late stage putting the delivery team under significant pressure leading into the blockade. Early engagement of supplier (Cintec) during design to mitigate programme delays and buildability issues. Single source procurement due to time constraints. Very tight programme. Delays in getting GS3&5 contract signed. Engage Bridge fabricator under ECI to help with design details. Limited access for surveys due to presence of tenanted structures Assumptions made in design .Request early occupation of structure. Underestimated complexity of structure - Complexity of bridge articulation – process took longer. Could have done modelling at GS4 Could have engaged EKSPAN much earlier. Intrusive Surveys not completed during GS3 &4. CRT assessment and management plans to be implemented early Engage NR maintenance as early as possible. Late changes to lifting details – connection of lifting points to deck plates to enable tilting of deck-plate at an angle Engagement of fabricator and lifting contractors. Missing detail from AFC drawings .Thorough review of AFC drawings NR standard details to be incorporated onto AFC drawings where refenced. TW Designs difficult to implement Consult experienced CRE’s within the business. Challenge unbuildable TWDs."
"Quality of Documentation - WPPs and TBR’s Set up .WPP workshop to train all personnel involved in producing WPPs. Significant Quantity of Documentation to be reviewed - WPPs and TBR’s Reduce number of WPP’s. Review number of significant WPPs. Particular Risk – Work at height – edge protection requirements. Review this risk during all GRIP stages. Include risk mitigation in permanent works design where practicable. Rescue plan for work at height. Review and add in WPP/CPP. Tracking Quality items, involvement in progress meetings. Quality advisors/management to be invited to progress meetings Quality advisors to carry out independent work inspections. Very Few NCRs raised. Encourage project personnel to raise NCR’s Project KPI and reporting each period. Procuring multiple affiliate packages across a number of projects, in particular steel and taking into consideration the The business needs to create a standard ‘form’ / process on how we seek authority and who’s responsible. Currently, it’s a time scales to obtain authority to proceed with an external supply chain member, rather than Murphy International. statement only, therefore a lot of back and forth occurs trying to provide adequate justification, rather than it being clear on what is required, and the content. Project (incl CAW6) lost 2-4 weeks in programme waiting for a decision. Procuring off insufficiently detailed design drawings, causing ambiguity and difficulty in normalising, particularly complex packages. Ensure adequate programme durations are in place to enable effective procurement practices. Great example of cross functional collaboration between all facets of the Project (Ops, Engineering, Commercial, Procurement) to achieve an extremely difficult programme. N/A – albeit – a lesson learnt shouldn’t be about “problems” only, we should share our success, I particularly do not agree with the column heading “summary of issues”. we have some great examples of cross functional working on Morris Street that should be shared. Great example of cross functional collaboration between all facets of the Project (Ops, Engineering, Commercial, Procurement) and the CLIENT (NR) – severe downward pressure on supply chains, extended lead times and price hikes. Working with NR we were able to bring forward procurement to mitigate / de-risk."
"Labour quants exceeding allowances. Work with labour manager to ensure right competences are provided from the start. Plant still charged to contract after being off hired. Avoid site-site transfers Keep good record of plant off hires Escalate to senior management if required. Inexperienced, supervision, engineers for possession management. Engage wider business for supervision with appropriate experience."
"All surveys required as per the survey specification were carried out and completed in line with the programme. As part of the drainage survey requirements, an outfall into the nearby brook from track needing confirming. Due to obstructions within the pipe this was not possible via means of jetting/CCTV, this was however proved via means of dye testing. The designer required some further detail picking up as part of the topographical survey to the failure area, this was obtained quickly and efficiently. GPS Signal caused issues with the Topographical Survey. A change in methodology was made allowing the Survey to be carried out."
"Topographical survey team did not pick up everything required by the designer on the planned allocated shift even though a thorough start up meeting was held. GPR survey unable to give out acceptable reading due to ground conditions. One of the outfalls into the brook required a CCTV survey, the team in attendance felt this could not be achieved due to location. There was a change in methodology required in the Topographical Survey due to the signal issues on site. NCR issued due to continuous errors from SEP topographical survey team, at risk of being removed from supply chain. GPR surveys not recommended on any other terrain bar road Sub-contractor’s representative attending the walkout to attend site during the survey works. Going forward, any issues with signal etc. should be raised to JMS as early as possible to enable us to assist as much as we can."
"Good communication between all parties prior to works commencing each week. Pre-Start meetings held on a weekly basis. Ensure Pre-Start meetings are held each week to discuss the upcoming works. Good management during possessions from JMS. The full shift was utilised, and JMS ES/COSS was accommodating to works. Good communication between JMS, Subcontractor and Design with any issues that arose on site (i.e. drilling locations). Good flexibility. Surveys findings where submitted to JMS in good timing once completed. Having all parties involved and communicating with one another from early on in the project worked well and having all involved in Pre-Start meetings."
"Better site visit to be arranged on future sites. No track access was utilised and could not see beyond the fence. Ensure a possession is booked for anything that can not be seen off-track. De-Vegetation was running concurrent with the Topo and GI Works. De-Vegetation to be completed prior to Topo and GI works attending site to commence their works. Rope Access – issues with communication as to rope access being supplied on site. Ensure that rope-access is booked, and all parties are away of who is supplying the rope access (JMS or Subcontractor). Delays in Lab Testing Lab. Testing Schedule to be returned to subcontractor in better time to avoid to delays. Issue with access for the monitoring. Better planning going forward for the monitoring as well as the surveys. Lab Testing not included in the original BoQ. Ensure that this is ironed out before works commence and included in final quote. Draft report submitted by Central Alliance, no clear on the missing information and what was to be included in the final. Quality checking on survey information by Subcontractors before final submissions are sent."
Very good visibility and support from the PM throughout .It would help to have the project management team in place well before the start of the project. Paul Brady’s experience was invaluable in getting this project over the line.
"Ainscough, Abbey scaffolding, Murphy piling, Vann &Gulliver, Water seal, Profix steel fixers and Tera Ferma all very good. TRS Roadstone poor which was down to price not the best quality and not the cheapest quality."
"A bit thin on the ground for some tasks, i.e., members of the team helping out on other projects .In general resourcing was good .In the first month it would have helped to have another body on site set up etc.. Good help from Barney Carragher’s team at the start of December which was more down to luck than planning."
Go Green-Eco efficiency with the swap over of skips created some challenges in getting skips in a timely manner. It got better as the project progressed .A late invite for One Winter affected the planning of work. Design issues- should be designing materials we can get hold of with the challenges of Brexit. An example being Ego covoid for ex land flex (Water seal) .Not having the time to stone up beside terraferma as a lot of activities going on at once .Late invite for One Winter ( day before) had a big effect on the daily activity including the delivery of 250 ton of stone. 17Metre telehandler came to site in poor condition. It took the delivery of 3 generators to site before they got a good working one. Everything else good .Poor communication on the changeover from red to white diesel. Should have been more specific. Security were made aware of the white diesel situation. Getting a final design on crane pads was slow in coming due to other Christmas works .Piling platform and crane pads could have been installed at the beginning of works and this would have saved time later. Positive- Crane pads designed to support both sized cranes.
"Going back 18 months cables were not located, found 6 months meaning we need experience and knowledge .Cables spiked before the team came on site . Services dealt with over the bridge .Paid twice for trial holes. Core possessions too tight together considering Christmas and cores. Polystyrene blocks-learnt a lot from Shakely lane .Not enough time beforehand, had to fight to get a start in November. Saving time puts lots of pressure on site teams .NR don’t assist in the planning stage, should have had more attention 3 years ago. It would be beneficial to get the core team involved at the planning stage .Lucky there was no breakdowns of the piling rig. Enough of everything but not enough time put aside for the set up. Could have done with another week. Sites should be fully set up before any other activities start."
"Fit to Finish- Make sure farmer, land owner are happy wit tidiness, fencing and seeding."
Good pre core briefing. Bringing people to Birmingham created a challenge with resources .Regular SHES site visits- very supportive.
Challenge during demolition due to noise. Other than that there was a good relationship .No challenges with the foot path closure .Limited access at Chew more lane benefitted the locals.
"Two members of the team are doing supervisor development .Training is getting much better.Polystyrene blocks worked really well. The whole project went well .Demolition, pulling in walls, road stripped saved time."
"There were issues with the access on the first possession shift caused by another Murphy worksite using our access point. This was not communicated before the shift. A meeting with the planner was held every week thereafter to ensure that there was no other work group in our worksite and if so, this was pre[1]planned so not to affect our works/access via the RRAP going forward. Good communication between all parties on site. Supervision from Murphy’s was very accommodating with good knowledge of the works being undertaken. Ensure that the Murphy Supervisor is confident in the works. Meetings/phone calls to be had before hand to run through the Specification. Pre-Start Meetings were held every week before the weekend works were due to commence. This allowed all subcontractors and the Safety Critical Staff to have an understanding of the works well in advance of the shift. Undertake weekly Pre-Start Meetings with the relevant Subcontractors and Site Personnel working on that shift(s). Site visits with JMS and Subcontractors too place prior to works commencing. This allowed all parties to get a good look at the job and highlighted any potential issues with regards to access etc. Ensure that Subcontractors have the opportunity to visit site during the Tendering Process. The De-Veg Operatives were on site throughout the duration of the works to assist the topographical team. Overlap de-veg with other activities to ensure that everything is cleared before leaving site. Post review meetings were held each week after the weekend works to run through what was done and go through shift reports/anything that didn’t get done, helping to ensure that this was picked up on the next shift. Hold post review meeting were applicable to discuss previous weekends works for updates etc. Helps to keep the works on track and ensure no information is missing. A Racecard detailing the work, meeting times, meeting points and supervision was issued every Friday for the next weeks upcoming works. This was very helpful and clear for all to see who the points of contact were etc. Populate Racecards on a weekly basis and share with all personnel that will be on site."
Access issues with regards OTP at RRAP were encountered on the first possession shift due to other contractors in our worksite (JMS). Better communication internally with planner to ensure our worksite is not affected. There was no plan/drawing with manhole/catch pit information provided. Have this information available so this can be updated/amended throughout the surveys. No track walkout was arranged before the works commenced. Get subcontractors involved with initial NWR walkout/have another track walkout planned. Difficulty marrying up the catch pit information between the drainage and topographical teams. Provide a plan that all subcontractors can work with for catch pit cards/manhole locations. Share information throughout the work’s rather than all at the end. Possibly look to use the same subcontractor for drainage and topographical investigations.
"Developing people on site, staff rotation on the shifts. Staff completing all tasks i.e. – Grouting, Soil Nailing etc as had a positive effect on the team and brought a good morale. Younger people also being given the opportunity to complete the tasks and people given the chance to progress from Lv2 – Lv3’s. Programme aligned with VA to JMS to utilise P6 software. VA purchased P6 during the scheme to ensure updates were as smooth as possible. Use going forward for larger schemes for all to use P6 as the overall client expects this. Site management changes from VA have progressed well and is working as team. Monitor overall. RRV and safety critical staff has been difficult sometime to secure due to VA not having a consistent trackside workload. Explore more than one supplier, better supplier relationships. 6no 29-hour blocks not productive has should have been. Prepping for the blocks lost time on the Mon & Fri however an extra row was installed with the RRV from trackside. Look at future block and measure the outputs gained to establish if they are value or money and best productive. Drilling foam has worked well, reducing noise, dust and stopping the bore holes from collapsing and better grouting as a result of this."
"Changes from form A to AFC have been a struggle to get agreed with the client and the programme needed revising after the claim to finalise. VA using P6 assisted in the programme submission and assisted with closing out the claim. VA’s estimated tender was very accurate and precise. Any tasks not detailed on the design needs to be detailed in the price submission due to the kick backs from the client and agreeing what has been allowed for. If a detail is missing on the design, we need to stress in our price submission what has been allowed for, i.e. what handrail, steps GRP etc. More possessions have been required than what was originally forecasted to complete the track works. TT to align with PTI especially for big ticket items i.e. RRV’s and track plant."
"TQ process has improved and is a lot quicker and smoother between VA – JMS – BLP - NWR Good working relationships between all engineering teams from each party. Temporary works procedure learning for VA, TWC, TWS and the process. Easement angles for the top row of anchors not achievable to drill and require a TQ to be submitted."
Site is run very well by all one minor grout incident since the scheme. Feedback card / Close call numbers are low due to the amount of person hours on site. Team to have a big poush on feedback and stress the importance of this during the feedback Friday sessions.
"Weekly output tracker is keeping a good track of the number of nails being installed and m2 mesh to be tracked. Slit trenches to be excavated at the toe to mid slope to identify any unchartered cables to avoid delays. Outputs are approximately 2 weeks behind due to stand down, the blockade working and re-drilling due to the poor ground. Foam to be used on the portal and the DN has this was a good initiative from working on the UP Foam is working well and eliminating collapses."
"Well organised- good planning, ensuring everyone is happy and any issues that there is, are solved that suits all workers. Setting standards from the start, allows an understanding of the way murphy works which will be taken throughout the whole project. N/A improvements .Communication- within the management team, no barrier (always listen)."
"Open conversations about any issues – solved instantly .Management of deliveries – well structured, workflow efficient .Sub-contractors feel like part of the Murphy family .Great moral, very uplifting team."
"Resources struggle – sometimes (agency) more hard work than necessary – blockades with agency, too often make main men feel like they are behind, as the work is not done up to standard that is required. We can fix this by, being more precise about the agency staff that are requested. Shy on men – workload is much more intense when the quantity of workers is not where it needs to be."
"Error is catch pit – 2 week hold up, however, quickly turned around .Farmer could have tested soil in advance. Used a lot more stone than we expected to – a lot more TQ’s on the job. Also a lot of GI’s for the job. More experienced people – eg machine drivers should be able to notice problems that are most likely to occur when the project has started. Nobody seems to ask the groundsmen or core team for their advice when constructing the plan. More parties involved in the build abilities (core team involved in the whole plan such as foremen. Ivor king has been very well managed and worth with JMS. GPS didn’t work on machine controls -there was no test run with technology, less efficient and team had to use the old ways, even though we should be using new technologies. In the future, include it within the price, hold supply chain responsible for something not working that should. All familiarised with the Prolec with training. Had everything that we need, used the new piling machine that has never been used before. Delivering great quality work. Only downfall is the amount of men needed for the machine to work. Does not give off any vibrations as it is only press. Had more time for the temporary works – have to go through more levels of endurance. Had to do it the quickest way rather than the most efficient way. Very good collaboration between Murphy supervisor and ivor King. 6m pipe – 5m drag box did not work. Use shorter length pipes or longer drag boxes. End plates or pieces for trench boxes, would be much better and safer tor those working inside them. Had to reduce ground because it was deeper than what was originally thought, used products we already had and make it work.

"Well maintained, and great amount of space Very well hidden off the main road to still fit in with the aesthetics of the area. Great lighting for enhance safety Lovely social areas for break to build team relationships. Core teams not involved in the plan The plan has worked and is thorough. Supervisors need to come together with ones from subbies also. People being moved around has an impact on the plan – if someone goes on a training course they are not replaced. Replacements do not know the job. Hinders the progress. Very clean area .Environment of site fits in with the area."
"Farmer – become quite greedy, just wants more and more .We can prevent this by contacting and liaising with the land agents."
Not much exposure with SHES – could be more. This is also a positive as the men are trusted and not being challenged for the job they are doing. Reminders of SHES does help .7 CDP site visits for site support and events. Culture on this job is great – save environment. Everyone works and pulls together. Morning briefings and debriefing every day on the job.
Local People are very protected of the area; we provide the public is enough information to allow them to understand the job.
"Great opportunity to gain tickets to develop a good understanding. Tickets are a great way for development on the job. Aaron on RRV, liam gaining many tickets."
Commercial awareness – better understanding for supervisors and engineers More site visibility from the QS .Could do with a shower. Access to piling platform is quite difficult. Housekeeping is good. Need to keep a big focus on this as we go into the next phase of the works.

"Scheme did not require any bespoke solutions and hence did not require a F004; the details provided by the designer at F002/003 were sufficient to carry out the scheme bar any details which were uncovered when the canopy was stripped. The station was not listed and therefore did not need a F004. Increase in the scope of works once the scaffold had been erected and allowed to strip the canopy; more specifically, this was the timber surrounding the valley gutter where this abutted the atrium roof which was deemed to be un-usable. The refurbishment of the atrium roof, originally in the scope, was de-scoped when the Grip 6-8 RF8 budget was produced only to be added as a variation once the timber had been exposed and deemed rotten. JMS to ensure that staff with the relevant experience are involved in attending surveys to ensure that the Designer is collecting suitable information to feed into the design. Trial holes and window sampling were carried out circa 40m away from the works extent and were unsuitable for the purposes of designing the scaffold. M&E surveys should have clearly identified that none of the of connections in the distribution board were labelled and identified. Orchard (roofing sub contractor) identified an alternative solution to a roofing detail. • From a personal point of view ARCADIS were very approachable and happy to engage with JMS • Receptive to receiving buildability comments from JMS operations/delivery team. • Willing to work with us when JMS expressed concerns about the M&E CRE-d. Steelwork repair survey could have been improved. There were areas of steelwork around near to where the dagger boards were fixed on both platforms where significant section loss was present to the steelwork. This could have been spotted during the surveys but wasn’t. This led to steelwork repairs being required whilst on site which caused additional design and installation costs. Best practice crash deck, encapsulation etc. (weatherproof, good walking routes, safe). Good feedback from NR. Good compound size was provided allowed for good working practice, awarded Safety Banner, good standard of welfare. Risk to NR from a Grip 6-8 point of view as certain aspects of the structure are deemed not accessible and therefore caveated • Investigate whether JMS have efficiently used the allowance for the surveys. In this scheme, the timbers were accessible and could have been determined as being unusable at the design stage. Make use of the allowance made in the contract to send out competent staff to monitor the designer on site and ensure sufficient information is collected. Ensure pre/post survey meetings are held promptly and the final survey report is scrutinized to ensure that surveys have been carried out correctly. ARCADIS have replaced the CRE-d with someone else on future schemes going forward • More scrutiny to be given to the M&E survey reports to make sure that nothing lacks for either permanent or temporary works. • Potentially involve MES during the surveys. There is a feeling that this alternative solution could have been picked during the ITTs so as to avoid any delays on site (programme and financial) 1. Offer more time for specific packages (which may include trickier details and require further assessment) to return tender submissions 2. Investigate inviting certain targeted sub contractors to DRM to help input into designs. Cross involvement of operations team into other similar schemes to not to lose any good knowledge generated from different schemes. More thorough and detailed surveys to be undertaken during Grip 4 design stages. • More emphasis within the designer brief detailed these surveys. • Clear descriptions in their CTR and contract detailing the level of inspection and surveys required. Best practice to be shared across business. To be resolute on the provision of sufficient space for compound."
"Site Manager continuity between similar schemes and with little down time between projects. Site Manager also had sufficient time to get involved with the detail of the scheme and built a relationship with the painting and steelwork subcontract making them easier to manage. ORCHARD (Roofing Sub contractor) provided a site manager to monitor the progress of their own subcontract package which ensured that their works were wer delivered well. Initial works contract allowed TW and CPP/WPP to be produced early. Last Man Planning. Independent Paint Inspector was not as thorough as the Client paint inspector leading to re-works and deficient performance. No Engineer on site even though this was requested and priced for in the price submission. This threatens getting the scheme right the first time. Positive relationship with both the TOC and NR. Submitted good feedback for a well-developed scheme. BoQ – good take-off by the estimator made the job of the procurement team much easier. Visibility of future schemes important in keeping Site Team and the benefit should be communicated to NR. Depending on the value/size/complexity (definition/expectation to be determined) of the package, it may be good to request the sub[1]contractor to provide a non-working supervisor. Initial works contract should be a standard procedure agreed with NR and guarantees compliance with the JMS “Fit to Start” requirement. Understanding our internal competencies and to not exclude our site team (Supervisor, Team Leaders, Site Managers etc) to develop and refine our design. JMS to use the same Paint Inspector as the Client (NR) to avoid to ensure consistency between reports sent to NR and to JMS. This will ensure that we “get it right” first time. Need more Engineers to shoulder the work from the CRE C. To be discussed with the Engineering Lead. Identify on the PEP and “Fit to Start” the resource that is required. Maintain and build relationships with the relevant stakeholders. - It is worth looking outside of our usual sub[1]contractors who may provide better vfm. - There is a possibility of using companies who are not RISQS approved. Longer disruptive access for scaffold erection have proved beneficial and should be requested on future schemes where scaffold access is required. To be reinforced with NR. Doing this exercise on similar scheme where dagger boards are present. JMS to follow companywide policies on the subject until further notice. To maintain same level of consistency."
"Duration of project 8 weeks faster than planned. This was because there were changes of subcontractors from the time the price was submitted who were able to work quicker. Good selection of sub-contractors, in particular ORCHARD who have been performing well on canopy/roofing schemes - It is worth looking outside of our usual sub[1]contractors who may provide better vfm. - There is a possibility of using companies who are not RISQS approved. Possession (+ve) Longer disruptive access for scaffold erection have proved beneficial and should be requested on future schemes where scaffold access is required. To be reinforced with NR. Dagger boards were identified to be refurbished. A commercial review was undertaken to ascertain the possibility of replacing in its entirety with GRP Doing this exercise on similar scheme where dagger boards are present. Delivered to programme despite the pandemic JMS to follow companywide policies on the subject until further notice. Fit to Finish and submission of H&S file on course to be finished on time and as per NR/JMS requirement. To maintain same level of consistency."
Win Win relationship with the TOC – scaffold crash deck and hoarding allowed works to be carried out safely during the pandemic. Relationships to be nurtured and the importance and value of segregating works properly/safely to be shared with NR. NCR were raised as required. E.g. against JMS plant (generator which did not work). Project has made a profit. Promoting internally from Assistant Quality advisor to Assistant Site Manger diversifying the capabilities of JMS internal capacities.
"Good relationship with the NR Construction Manager, SPM and PM. Feedback on the project by the stakeholders has been positive. Successful work during the pandemic – no outbreaks in personnel both JMS and sub-contractors. No H&S incidents."
"The Dowel bars and an amount of concrete was missed out of the estimate in error (£10K). Check the Quantities before submission and have a team review prior to submission. Steel rebar ordered for both the PCC and in situ elements with the PCC elements then being surplus to requirements and subsequently occurred a cost against the scheme .Rebar utilised on an alternative product and was not disposed off but verification of orders required on future projects to ensure no money being wasted. Surplus Polystyrene blocks from Shackerley Lane had been planned to be utilised for this scheme and was stored in Kennedy Road for using on this scheme but was never used thus a potential opportunity was not realised. Communication between all of the project team to be improved to enable opportunities to be recognised. Now the project will incur disposal costs for the removal of this material from Kennedy Road. Disposal in this case it was positive as material was recycled as required but could have caused financial loss if not recycled on site. As a general comment we under-price waste – Waste pricing are based on previous projects. Management of cost and change. Positive observation – keep up the good standards. P-Card need a business review .Daily expenses to high – to shop around for cheaper – Amazon looks like it is cheaper on Tea and Coffee and small consumables. Overall, the project is looking to potentially return 1-2% .Positive that it isn’t returning at a loss but looking at the simple wins that the site team could have reported the agreed stretch target and not a small return. Although weekly meetings and monthly meetings taking place not all the meetings have been recorded within the correct procedure and minutes produced. Positive observation that they have taken place but improvement required on recording the conversations and producing minutes."
"The site team had issues sourcing the waterproofing materials specified on the drawings, an alternative was sourced but cause delay during the construction phase. Review information stated on drawings on future schemes to enable less disruption during construction phase. Due to the change in method for the filler beams (from PCC to in[1]situ) there was a requirement to brace the structure whilst the concrete was poured. This created a requirement for JMS to contact MAE for a design which subsequently was not required, and the project incurred unrecoverable costs. On future projects temporary works / permanent works to be established and identified earlier in the programme. CRE was needing to complete take off’s and order materials which usually is completed by the site engineer. This applied additional workload on the CRE has the potential to jeopardise other critical activities. This was due to the engineer for the scheme being deployed on an alternative scheme and on annual leave. Holidays to be planned and sufficient cover required on future schemes. With the over order of steel and polystyrene it was identified that the engineer should be completing the take offs and not relying on the site manager and CRE to complete these duties. Ensure correct members of the team completing the take off’s and required paperwork. Murphy Ground Engineering were involved within the buildability conversations and development alongside JMS and TGP the designers on the scheme. Positive observation and should be implemented on future schemes. There was limited information from TGP at Form001 stage this led to some length commercial discussions during the construction phase of the works. Liaise with designers and seek the possibility of additional information of future schemes."
"Overall, the service from the supply chain was good .Positive observation – keep up the good standards. Terrafirma – the required additional pins and caps not fully executed despite being included within the enquiry and numerous phone calls to the supplier. This information is to be fed back into the JMS steering group to reinforce the requirements with terrafirma. At the start of the project there was issues with the generator provided for the site establishment. The generator was exchanged 3 times and on the 3rd time the generator was adequate and worked well throughout the duration of the project This was fed back to MPL at the time of the event and closed out at source. The quality of the stone from GRS at the beginning of the project was poor and this led to reviewing and swopping the supplier. This was fed back to the supply chain at the time. SHES – 4 Week look ahead completed with the site management and supervision. Positive observation – keep up the good standards. It was discussed that it would have been good to have a smaller compound at the start of the project whilst setting up the haul road and the main compound. Point taken and will look to include in future schemes. The location of the main compound was discussed in respect of it being positioned in an alternative location. Ensure whole team involvement and participation at planning stages and when producing the Project Execution Plan. All monthly meetings on site can be combined or just set aside a full morning to cover all aspects instead of having separate meetings for each discipline i.e. HSQE, Commercial and Operations. Review on site meetings and combine whole team into 1 overall monthly meeting that captures HSQE, Commercial, Operational and AOB opposed to 3 or 4 separate meetings. With excess of 25,000 accident and incident free hours worked on the project .Positive observation – keep up the good high standards."
The trackway installation and site mobilisation were not 100% complete and the physical works needed to commence. On plan and from previous lessons learnt the programme appeared to be adequate but it is also noted that a number of JMS operatives took annual leave at the start of this project (as it was the back end of the calendar year). Review future programmes and annual leave of operatives (all leave being held to end of calendar year). The polystyrene infill programme was based on a previous scheme as completed and on site there was a discussion on site as to if the works could be completed differently by means of building the infill walls to full height and then completing the infill at the end instead of in stages This proved positive and it would be beneficial in future to involve the workforce in the planning stages. Due to storm Eunice the installation of the new bridge was aborted during the core weekend. This required further access to be requested and subsequently this prolonged the overall programme duration on site. Challenge decisions made by the client. Make an allowance for bad weather due to time of year during the ATC submissions and identify within the risk and opportunities register.
"The design validation process compared a range of design approaches from betterment to a full EC7 design for each area of the site based around back analysis of failure mechanism to derive less conservative soil parameters. Collaborative working between Murphy geotech specialists, our designer Atkins, & the NR RAM Team allowed an appropriate design approach to be matched against the defects and failure mechanism identified, with significant cost savings (approx. 40% of initial budget at GRIP4). Dissemination of good design practice developed for use in other similar schemes (approach captured within Murphy Railway Earthworks Design & Construction Guide). Ensure appropriate in-house specialist geotech input for design input for complex earthworks schemes. Maintain panel of key earthworks design specialists. Design quality by Atkins was high with a helpful, proactive approach across all team members. Meeting presentation included clear, concise presentations which assisted design decisions. Positive feedback to designer & procurement on Atkins’ performance. Soil nail pull-out testing completed as part of detailed design resulted in approximately 30% reduction in soil nail metreage. Given the inherent conservatism of soil nail design methods, early sacrificial pull-out testing recommended for most soil nail schemes unless good existing data is available or schemes are so small that cost of pull out testing would negate any possible savings. Use of sacrificial pull-out testing captured within Murphy Railway Earthworks Design & Construction Guide. PEP development was limited prior to start of the project. The PEP did not set out assumed resources or fully detail method of working, in part due to PM resourcing issues (no APM, cover for site staff etc). The Fit to Start form was not fully complete prior to commencement. Ensure PEP development completed with of whole project team including detailed resourcing and method of working agreed. Ensure Fit to Start form completed prior to adjudication. Provide sufficient PM resource to achieve this. The temporary works register was developed late due to lack of availability of suitable TWC. This resulted in delays in identifying temporary works design requirements. Ensure temporary works register completed with PEP. Ensure TWC resource available. Use of recycled plastic hanit planks for cess support as alternative to concrete planks was faster more sustainable, safer and allowed a no-bonding solution. Disseminate use of recycled plastic planks (case study already provided). Fixing of handrails on outside of H piles via pre-drilled holes was similar in time to construction of post holes and more sustainable (less materials – no concrete or twin wall and uprights shorter). Consider fixing handrails to H piles for similar schemes. Changes to the cess support detail from cubis boxes to concrete planks were needed around OLE stanchions due constructions near OLE bases (concrete extending beyond bases, old OLE bases etc). More detailed assessment of conditions around OLE stanchions including locating old bases and considering the implications of overbreak around bases. Review extant of site support needed from design for more complex schemes. Extensive detailing adjustments required around lineside S&T structures to maintain the new cess and access for the maintainer. Additional detailing should be provided around lineside structures including sections to pick up level differences. Review extant of site support needed from design for more complex schemes. H piling installed above existing sheet pile wall could have been removed and replaced with a simpler alternative, this would have also simplified detailing around the S&T structures. Ensure section are pieced through all existing structures to enable effective design review. Late specification of topsoil requirements caused issues with obtaining a suitable supply. Ensure planting and landscaping requirements developed as early as possible so that supply issues can be addressed. Ensure detailed specification for topsoil provided. Responsibility for long-term embankment monitoring not made clear on drawings requiring clarification via meeting with RAM & subsequent GC – misunderstandings could have been expensive. Ensure long term monitoring of instruments and settlement monitoring points is clearly defined on drawings as NR responsibility to avoid misunderstandings. Environmental Management Plan was poor and there were issues with obtaining the right consents/understanding which consents were required. Resolved by change in team. Early review of consents and EMP as part of PEP development. Subcontractor bond was not properly included in the soil nail subcontractor’s proposal which could have exposed the company to commercial risk (soil nailing finished before this could be resolved) Bond requirements to be reviewed prior to tender acceptance. Permanent works ITP wasn’t formed, checked, and approved on time (more than 28 days prior work commenced). ITP should have been more detailed. Adequate engineering resources. Planning and preparing early. Making sure ITP is created at an early stage to allow time for reviews and amendments. Expiry of a consent during works required rapid renewal. Ensure better records of date of consents and expiry kept on site. Access to existing inclinometers (installed prior to works) during monitoring prevented since external contractor had no suitable safe method of access Consider use of automated instruments for future monitoring and or methods of safe access. Need for safe access method for future monitoring highlighted to NR. Completion of landscaping design after main AFCs lead to late identification of potential issue, ordering of planting etc. Costs could not be included in target cost. Ensure that landscaping design completed part of main works design."
"The site & project team worked together to overcome significant challenges and deliver the scheme successfully. Positive feedback to the team. Site engineering team worked hard to address the early resourcing issues and stay on top of engineering tasks. Positive feedback to the team. Rapid response from Atkins to site issues and positive, helpful approach throughout speeded up resolution. Positive feedback to designer & procurement on Atkins’ performance. Lack of experienced engineering resource early in the construction phase resulted in delays in undertaking key tasks such as setting out, take offs, setting up inspection records, temporary work supervision, and establishing supervision of subcontractors. Whilst this was eventually rectified, including additional regular site support from CEM, it could have had serious impact on the programme or the quality of work undertaken. It also placed unnecessary stress on the project team and detracted from other activities such as routine supervision. Ensure suitable experienced engineering resource available from commencement of project on site to ensure that engineering systems properly established for commencement of main works. Price in & programme sufficient early engineering resource. Covid restrictions/lack of face-to-face whole team meetings made effective planning more difficult – input/perspective from whole of team valuable. Schedule early whole-team site meetings for planning. Lack of resource including experienced supervisors early in project life hampered effective planning of scheme and supervision which could have had more serious consequences. Lack of site resource required additional input from Site Manager, taking him away from other tasks and in turn the Site Manager needed additional regular site support from PM impacting his tasks. Ensure fully resourced site team available from outset. Changes in resource allocation occurred throughout the project with little or no notification to the project. This affected the cohesion of the team, its morale and productivity. Project team should be consulted well in advance of any staff changes and the impact of these on the project taken properly into account. Lack of suitably experienced plant operators and Machine Controllers limited progress of H piling works during possessions. Lack of company RRVs meant that external plant had to be sourced which came with its own less experienced drivers. Ensure plant operators with H piling experience available. Monitoring communications plan approach ensured appropriate review process for multiple sources of monitoring data. Employ monitoring communications plans for similar schemes (approach captured within Murphy Railway Earthworks Design & Construction Guide). Delays in production of required records and test results from soil nailing contractor requiring commercial communication and risking a requirement for return or rework. Early agreement on schedule for delivery of test results and agreement on remedial response for delays to prevent any backlog in results. Issues with performance of subcontractors to be fed back to procurement team. Grout washout control by subcontractor was poor (they were not following their own procedures) leading to comers that grout could be washing into drainage. Though this did not occur an Environmental Incident was notified. Ensure resource available for supervision & checks of subcontractor operations. Ensure a bunded grout wash-off area set up where grouting is taking place. Working platform controls were not always fully maintained. Clearer setting out of working platform controls on temporary works drawings. Delays in agreeing a suitable working at heights system for works along the cess. Provide clearer guidance on arrangements for working embankments. Review all working arrangements in PEP for suitable SHES team input. Including ROIs on Aconex field worked well. Note: Templates could have been made pre-works. Encourage use of Aconex field. Changes in company guidance on preparation of WPPs required production of additional documentation by subcontractors affected the consistency and integration of safety documentation. Guidance was subsequently changed to revert back to previous arrangements for WPP production. Clear guidance on safety documentation is required."
Delays in commencement of works occurred due to NR budgeting issues. NR were kept fully aware of the impact on programme. Better planning of resources would have allowed savings on the programme. Ensure projects fully resourced with right levels of experienced staff.
"Project completed on time and within budget – always deliver. Photogrammetry drone survey undertaken FoC by Atkins as demonstration project providing excellent exposure of the project, excellent progress images and benefiting Network Rail and nearby landowners (RSPB). – win-win relationships Promote opportunity from rapid drone photogrammetry surveys for future schemes (webinar with Atkins planned including NR). Consider use of drones for all significant schemes for progress & publicity photos. Consider putting logs on top of cabins for drone footage. Spare Type 1 fill removed as part of reinstatement of working areas supplied for reuse to local landowner, minimising disposal costs and providing additional benefits to local resident – win-win relationships Environmental case study prepared. Excellent management of 3rd party relationships with landowners and Natural England despite complexities of project. – win-win relationships."
A positive collaborative approach maintained throughout with client. This enabled agreement on the approach for optimising the F001 design. Completed scheme looks good and with positive feedback on the completed works and the design process. Positive regular interface with NR maintainer and improvement of access to S&T asset.
"Agreement on an accelerated design development with the support of our embankment stabilisation designer Atkins allowed Murphy to propose a soil nail solution to address the increase in slope movements resulting in a long-term rather than temporary fix, minimising the cost of reactive works. Ensure appropriate in-house specialist geotech input for design input for complex earthworks schemes. Maintain panel of key earthworks design specialists. Promoting the combining the already designed culvert replacement with the slope stabilisation scheme should have resulted in cost and programme savings and allowed effective integration between the two elements. N/A. There was good co-ordination between the two designers and integration of the two designs. Both designers (Atkins for the soil nailing & JBA for the culvert) performed well, producing high quality designs with a helpful proactive approach and timely responses. Positive feedback to designers & procurement. JBA worked closely with Murphy to allow modifications to the design to suite Murphy preferences. Positive feedback to designer & procurement. PEP development was limited prior to start of the project. The PEP did not set out assumed resources or fully detail method of working, in part due to PM resourcing issues (no APM, cover for site staff etc). The Fit to Start form was not fully complete prior to commencement. Ensure PEP development completed with of whole project team including detailed resourcing and method of working agreed. Ensure Fit to Start form completed prior to adjudication. Provide sufficient PM resource to achieve this. Use of recycled plastic hanit planks for cess support as alternative to concrete planks was faster more sustainable, safer and allowed a no-bonding solution. Disseminate use of recycled plastic planks (case study already provided). Fixing of handrails on outside of H piles via pre-drilled holes was quicker than construction of post holes and more sustainable (less materials). Easier to maintain in future. Possibly quicker to install with concrete in some circumstances. Consider fixing handrails to H piles for similar schemes. No buildability assessment completed by NR prior to design issue to Murphy.

Absenteeism of site manager This should be avoided as no leadership on site is a recipe for disaster. Should a Site manager be unreliable, then senior management must take a swift decision and appoint someone else to run the project."
Poor quality of works .JMS have had a history of problems with JA Stevenson (Hartford) so it may be sagacious not to use them again until their quality controls are up to standard (reliable).
" Lack of communication between. Network Rail and Heritage rail over the refurbishment of the platform waiting shelters Despite the advice of heritage project experts, Network Rail maintained that the shelters be renovated on site thus incurring extra TW design costs and delays to the programme."
 Electric buses. Use of electric buses to ferry the workers around JMS should continue to be at the forefront of environmentally friendly systems. This practice should be replicated where the site is some distance away from the compound. Generally good practice for the environment Refer to the value engineering log for further information.
"Design development was stop-start from F001 (AiP) to F003 (Detail design). Change of personnel within JMS meant that a lot of historical knowledge was lost and was poorly recorded on Design Review Logs, meaning that the rationale behind certain decisions was lacking. This had a profound effect on the pricing of the scheme which was for Grip 5-8. It is very important to keep DRL logs up to date and record any changes which have been agreed as this document is the supporting evidence when it comes to discussing variations with NR. LOCROS is another example where, due to poor record keeping, variations are very hard to agree. M&E was originally de-scoped from the scheme and turned out to be one of most critical aspects of the scheme (lift and shift of cables through platform). The de-scoping of M&E works was a recurrent theme on several schemes during this time (think Harrow & Wealdstone) and this complicated the schemes no end. The list of exclusions and clarifications in bids must explicitly exclude the effect of de/re-scoping works in the bid so that JMS are commercially protected. EPS is certainly innovative and merits further investigation (after all an 80m platform was installed in less than 50hrs) but the market is very short on suppliers meaning we are at the mercy of a few number of contractors. Management of the subcontractor is crucial in these works if we intend to do more works of this nature. Alternatively, JMS should acquire the expertise to carry similar works so that we can self-deliver."
"Site manager was appointed late to the scheme and was inexperienced in railway and JMS processes and procedures. Did not realise the intricacies and the forward planning required when working on the railways (e.g. ordering safety critical staff late). One instance of this unfamiliar of the railway environment led to the closing down of the site for a period of time (working next to live OLE). Once it was evident that site managerial duties weren’t being fulfilled, panic struck by the operations management, and the site was flooded with site managers, supervisors and labour. None of which were accounted for within the original cost plan. The new Site Manager should have been shadowed by an experienced JMS employee to teach him how to order/material/ staff etc. This would have taken the burden off slightly and allowed the SM to concentrate a bit more on planning for the job. If we are to hire more inexperienced SM, we need to somehow include for a more senior SM/CM to be on the job part of the time. This should prevent future cost overruns. Change of delivery methodology. At Pre ATC stage, it was deemed JMS would provide all the plant and staff to remove existing platform. However, 3-4 weeks prior to the main Christmas blockade, we were instructed to let the works to Megatech, at short notice – effectively meaning we were held to ransom for the works (circa £25k loss on this activity). Senior Management in the business need to realise that we are no longer a self-delivery model contractor, and ensure they are more in touch with the projects, rather than put the team / project (onsite or in the office) under undue pressure at short notice because we do not have the internal capacity to deliver works. In the space of 6 weeks, we lost 2 PMs. The PM’s came and went during a very critical time of this project, without providing any meaningful contributions. Contracts Manager then had to step into the role of PM at a time when 2 large schemes were to be delivered by JMS over the Xmas blockade (Nottingham canal). Different geographic locations, different requirements made it difficult to manage. We were clearly not fit to start on such a high profile scheme and a contingency plan should have been in place – perhaps allow the CM to lead the scheme in the interim. We need to focus a lot more on being Fit To Start before going into upcoming schemes and take this seriously throughout the delivery team. A 50k overspend on the Pre-ATC design contract was absorbed on the ATC contract. This has been standard practise on lot 9 in the past, although the project QS did raise this as a risk early on in the project, due to a change in Network Rail and their perception of the contract. In future, a new job number should be setup for all new ATC’s and previous overspends on Pre-ATC contracts should remain a loss unless agreed by NR upfront. ack of site records (perhaps due to senior staff being pulled away from their core works) meant that challenging MegaTech over their variation application was extremely difficult (our word against theirs). As 2.3. During the Xmas blockade, the existing platform materials were stockpiled in a small area between a children’s nursery and a multi-storey car park next to the compound. This was the only area provided to us by NR. This resulted in the waste becoming mixed which needed to be separated before being disposed off-site. Due to the proximity of the nursery the separation and disposal of these waste materials could only take place at night time, resulting in this being a slower and more expensive process. JMS to insist on NR providing adequate compound and storage areas for all project moving forward. We are continually “shoe-horned” into small areas of NR land because it is easier and cheaper for them to organise, but the result is us suffering additional costs and potential H&S issues throughout our works."
"Scheme was completed within the 54 hour blockade and handed back without issue however the platform was not straight and this could have been rectified if personnel for the last shift had been organised for both JMS and Megatech. Whilst we must not plan to fail, having a contingency plan would have served us well in this instance and given us time to rectify platform. EPS system did allow for a quick and efficient install. A system to consider in the future for platform refurbishments and/or new build. Ordering of the fence was severely delayed due to the (late) involvement of the Fire Engineer who commented on the F003 design and requested a different fire rating than what had been anticipated. This was further complicated by the fact that the colour of the fence was changed by NR and it turns out that black GRP fence is notoriously difficult to get hold of (grey is the standard colour). Fire engineers are now involved in the F001/Grip 4 stage and their requirements can be captured early to include in the Grip 6 price. If schemes start at F002 (usually refurbishment schemes) then the F.E input needs to be received asap (preferably with contract docs) prior to developing the detailed design. Tag and Trace survey was done at Grip 5 after the Grip 5-8 cost was submitted and approved and this left us open Use the clarification and exclusion to protect JMS commercially. Issues with the permanent fence led to the necessity of installing a temporary fence which, according to the design codes which had to be satisfied, was extremely robust and perhaps over designed given the footfall on the platform. Whilst it is unlikely that NR will ever turn a blind eye to design codes, sensible conversations about the practicalities of such TW should be discussed early with the DPE. Design codes do not cater for each and every situation and this should be taken into account when discussing these with the DPE. The AFC’s detailed a below ground drainage system to the full length of the platform. This proved to be difficult to excavate given the lack of space between the rear of the new platform and the existing vehicle restraint barrier in the car park and excavating around existing lighting column foundations. This was also compounded by the fact that the drainage needed to be hand-excavated due to works being in the vicinity of the return conductor. The result of the above issues was that the works took in excess of 4 weeks to complete and was particularly labour intensive resulting in excessive costs to complete. Future schemes of a similar nature would benefit from a simple “gutter” arrangement fixed to the underside of the platform PCC units, which would outfall to a chamber and then connect into a short-run of below ground drainage into an existing drainage system. More buildability reviews to be undertaken during the design phase to consider activities such as this. Our temporary works design for the temporary RRAP from the car-park to track was excessive. We detailed a full timber RRAP which was bolted down to the existing timber sleepers, and steel plates over the troughing route. This RRAP would have stood up to 6 months of regular on/off tracking of RRV’s when in reality we only need a temporary RRAP (bog mats or the like) to allow 1 x RRV to track on/off once during the Xmas blockade. More buildability to be considered during TWD phase."
"“The Next Ten Years” Senior Management in the business need to realise that we are no longer a self-delivery model contractor, and ensure they are more in touch with the projects, rather than put the team / project (onsite or in the office) under undue pressure at short notice because we do not have the internal capacity to deliver works."
"Collaborative effort due to the time constraints led to a somewhat successful scheme. Maintain good relationships with the Client. Discussions over variations were, as usual, a tough process. DRL must be kept up to date and bid submissions to NR must reflect decisions taken in meeting."
"Clash between Civils and M&E F001's. M&E F001 stated that no equipment in the offices was to be altered. However, Civils F001 showed all walls being dot and dabbed over board. This would require all electrical equipment to the walls to be removed/replaced and any flush mounted sockets/switches would probably require re-wiring due to cable lengths. Also, any non-conforming parts of the installation would have had to be brought up to spec. This was identified prior to AFC drawings being issued, however NR wanted to proceed with the design, and it was to be reviewed once works commenced on site. The issues with the scope of work for M&E at the back of house was identified during the design phase, however this should have been better communicated to the site team. Site meeting was carried out with the TOC and NR to agree on the scope of works. TQ sent to NR. Ultimately this reduced the Civil scope of works. Civils design was lacking in some details. TQ’s had to be submitted to designer for details in certain areas as they had not been provided. The lack in detail should have been picked up during design phase. On future similar schemes, JMS to consider looking into designers who are more familiar with similar type of design."
Level issues of the floor screed which had an impact on the entrance tie in. No site engineer present while screed was poured as they had to cover another job. None but the tie in ramp could have been shallower. An engineer should have been on site to check levels as screed was poured. Level issues of the main steelwork. 30mm fall from back to front. Had an impact on the falls of the canopy roof and ceiling levels for plastering. None however it impacted other works • Ceiling plastering • Joist tie ins with the wall • Roof falls. Holding down strap not installed as per design. TQ submitted to designer for an alternative design. Missing strap should have been picked up prior to back of house works. Continuity of gangs on site – various electricians worked on the job and therefore never consistently being on the job. Scope clarification – to check if works can be resourced.
"Cladding – Design Stated Vitranamel by Valcan which had a minimum order of minimum 800m2 and the stainless-steel panels by bailey had a minimum order of 400m2. Procurement of these materials were hampered due to discussion between Everlast and suppliers. Everlast and JMS. JMS and Designer. JMS and Network Rail. In the end Alucobond A2 approved for both areas. Everlast should have identified this prior to works commencing on site. Numerous discussed were had to sort out approval of the cladding material. Various TQ’s been JMS/ Designers and Network Rail. Various material tiles were required to be sent to Network Rail. Cladding had a 12-week leading time. Should have been identified sooner. Due to site constructing the boundary walls of the store room/ concourse and WC/ Electrical Room, this impacted the fire stopping. TQ sent to Designer of what site have built and required additional blocking up of the voids between the joints with fire stopping socks. We were unable to source the Marshals paviours which had been specified on the design as they had stopped production. This resulted in changing paviour types twice. RMF were able to supply an alternative, agreed with NR. However, these all came in different sizes which resulted in over ordering on material. Also time had to be spent to create a pattern to minimise cutting and ensuring the paviours where enough. TQ sent to Designers and NR with proposed type. Accepted after material tile sent to NR. This is the risk we take on when we inherit schemes however, a review of the specified materials could have saved some time. Un-Reasonable, difficult to source/procure items (Siberian Larch. Designed / thought of by the architect, however we had to go over and above our usual protocols for FSC marked timber, due to internal JMS questions. JMS unaware of timber sizes of flat roof and lantern that was to be demolished. This required more work than anticipated. Toilet design not 100% DFT as hand rails did not meet the spacing requirements. As per 1.2. Additional access hatched had to be installed as the ones specified on the design where not enough to allow for M&E access. Should have been picked up during the buildability phase of the scheme. The design did not provide any tie-in details for the concourse area and the footbridge. As per 1.2."
"Automatic Doors – TOC / Client preferred installer, not prepared / interested in supporting JMS on the scheme. This resulted in JMS engaging in an alternative supplier. Generally poor performance by the SIS. The glazing was leaking following installation, doors and windows installed poorly and therefore required further work. Subcontractor difficult to bring back to complete snagging works. Poor at closing out snagging’s. Since the completion of the project, snags have been identified by all parties however the snag list has been treated as a live document as snags are added on as others are closed. JMS need to get better at closing out jobs. We need to become familiar with the hand back process and implement it. Overall, the interaction with the TOC went well, despite having a few noise issues during the demolition phase of the scheme. JMS ensured that the station staff received regular updates of the works being carried out. Any concerns the TOC had, were actioned as efficiently as possible. BT and Severn Trent were difficult to engage with, despite early approach. This resulted in JMS carrying out works on water meter."
"For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence. Multiple staff turnover throughout delivery. There was a significant turnover of staff at all levels of this scheme. Circa 4-5 Project Managers and site managers. Let alone experience at delivering a Multi-discipline scheme. This severely Impacted on the delivery and programme with each PM putting his own spin / Stamp on the scheme with no experience. Orchestrated at a higher level. Since the scheme, the new COO Nick Fletcher has brought to JMS a Project staff selection form. This form highlights the experience, strengths and weaknesses of the Team. The PM Rich Nash has implemented this on the next Scheme and Tom Lacy Contracts manager has been made aware. PM’s altering Programme. PM’s new to the scheme altered programme and changed planned methodology some brought progress others did not. Unfortunately, the PM has overall governance of his Project and can change what he wants. The form above will show accountability to whom appointed him. The current site supervisor. An experienced supervisor who was pivotal in pulling back time on the programme with the Teams assistance. Will be utilized for similar schemes in the future as a good asset."
" Site Welfare and compound area not sufficient area and too far from site. Every time we go to work in a Train Station we have the same issue. NR lease the land to the TOC, whom in turn lease to a third party to manage the car park revenue. When we request Land Access from NR in the planning stage. The area we require is always reduced to the bare minimum. It is usually at the furthest point from the works also. This is because the TOC does not want to lose revenue and wants its paying passengers to be as close as possible. JMS and NR always fold to the TOC demands. Yet the minute something happens on site (Materials stacked in car park outside the compound or an accident due to not enough space.) They say we should have asked for more space. This is raised on every scheme, but nothing changes. We have had two incidents at Tring, which would attribute to confined space. Going forward we will see how willing JMS and NR are to give what space we require. Access strategy completed for future works including compound areas required to ensure enough space. Surveys insufficient for the areas required. Site surveys had taken place with designers and engineers present. Yet an assumption was made for the base of the retaining wall. It would have been very easy to have chased down the wall and followed the corbal of the wall as it stepped out. The result was that the works had to pause while a solution was sought. This solution cost money to manufacture, Install as well as programme delays. Which could have been mitigated if the survey had been thorough. The delivery team met with the designer to design a solution which would mitigate the need to undermine the wall or excavate spoil directly in front of it. This was designed fabricated and installed. Well done to Team. Wider team have been made aware of this issue to prevent in the future. Surveys report was not on the Trial Log template. Also, there was a clear contradiction between logs. There was a cable strike at site with a Piling rig and luckily no one was injured. When reviewed it was apparent that the survey Trial Hole log was a sketch and not on the template. There was discrepancy between the trial hole sketches. The AFC did not correctly illustrate actual cables present and showed cables in the wrong location. Going forward we have ensured that all designers and JMS supervisors on the surveys are using the JMS Trial hole record log to give a uniform documentation. Going forward we have ensured that all designers and JMS supervisors on the surveys are using the JMS Trial hole record log to give a uniform documentation. Changes of engineer throughout the project affected the project as new engineer had to learn about the scheme and processes. This was made by senior management. Engineering controls as part of the design are were in place. Contradictions between M&E and civils drawings. Lack on interdisciplinary checks and considerations. Process followed, lack of detail. Drawings to be cross referenced joint IDC to be carried out internally."
" JMS management of the designer could have been better. F001 showed a steel footbridge, Stairs and ramp on the West side. But a Mass filled concrete ramp on the East Side. Mass costly inefficiency. When I was given the F001 drawings to review for buildability I noticed the ramp. I raised my concerns to the CRE whom had not noticed it was concrete. I also informed the CEM of the significant cost duration and construction involved. I raised it to the PM and all parties. It was still shown in the F002/3. When challenged they said it was too prevent cars crashing through. The designer continued to progress the design that has cost JMS when a steel ramp would have sufficed with a crash barrier if required. JMS should have managed the designer. JMS should have managed the designer in the most efficient design. Snr management should have been involved. Designer assistance due to significant design issues there had to be numerous meetings on site at short notice to aid the site to progress delivery. The design engineer whom we worked with did attend most of the site meetings to try and close issues out and was well accepted. Potentially due to the CEM,CRE,PM. Designer CRE wasn’t available most of the time. Should have been more available to come to site. Lift shaft LOP panels. Insufficient width to meet 500mm requirements. Ensure designers are engaging with lift suppliers earlier to ensure requirements are captured. Lift shaft LOP panels. However, we created a solution that works that will be shared with others for others use. Checking of designs from subcontractors. (drain pipe) Ensure subcontractors drawings align with requirements. such as cladding systems. Cost saving, less risks, less snagging. Cutting slope design. Not considered by designer. No consideration for any temporary works design for ramp in area. Possible generic design for AFA schemes? This gives additional costs of design and has different aspects of design. Appeared to be lack of consideration of archive drawing showing historic structures that were buried in platform and current structure that had to be piled through. Archive drawings to be reviewed and obtained at the beginning of the project. Similar bolt clusters had different size holding down bolts causing confusion. Holding down bolts to be uniform throughout to avoid any issues with installation."
" Lack on consideration for temporary works of lift pit on platform 1. AFC drawings detailed below ground lift put to be constructed in front of 4m high retaining wall with no considerations for support. No concertation for foundations on retaining wall adjacent. Lack on consideration for temporary works of lift pit on platform 1. Overcame with solution using prefabricated lift pit shafts. Removed the need for temporary works equipment. Improved safety, manual handling and pitching sheet piles on a platform. Number of TWD for different cranes & piling rigs. 1 TWD for numerous crane sizes. Save on time and cost of numerous designs. Scaffolding design, 1.5mtr lifts to suit bricklayer and being built as brickwork completed. Scaffolding built in 2mtr lift with hop ups. To save on time. Temporary lighting on hoarding on platforms expensive. Project team to keep hold of items for future works."
" JMS direct labour on a whole where mostly very enthusiastic experienced men. Right experience men on site worked well. Certain disciplines on site need to complete other activities on site such as plant operatives getting out of machines when no plant activities are being carried out. This affects output and moral on site. Discuss resource operative when completing labour requests. Hotels and Lodge significant cost to the scheme. JMS had to take men on site whom live in the North of England or South Wales. With these men incurs significant hotel or subsistence costs to the scheme. Travel times affects working hours and output from operatives. Due to travelling to and from home on Mondays and Fridays. JMS can not be a competitive contractor if we have to price for and carry significant costs on men whilst productivity is only 4 days. JMS should either use local resources, considering we have large offices in the North, Midlands and south. Or sub let the work to a local contractor. Labour forecast are being completed 2 years in advance through power BI. When completing project costs we are to plan for a percentage of the workforce to lodge to help recover costs. Where men are travelling, they are less likely to work on weekend shift which can be required on works. This leads to having to find additional labour to cover weekend shift. Weekend labour is unfamiliar with the project. Changes in the project’s Document Controller led to inconsistent document control, numbering etc., Some documents were not being ‘document controlled’ ie ITP (via emails instead), Subcontractor RAMS and ITPs. Subcontractor RAMS and ITPs (for bespoke permanent materials) need forwarding to the DC for recording and also the document review decal completing, indicating review and acceptance. Training for DCs – particularly those new to the business. Aconex will help but still relies on uploading documentation and the forwarding of documentation to the DC. Lack of skilled labour within the business to be able to self-deliver works. Delay to the project to try and find skilled trades leading to increased costs. Future works are planned in BI to plan for the required skills to ensure enough operatives are trained and skilled in the required areas such as steel fixers. More Junior site managers employed as site manager on different scheme out of current experience. An experience site manager in AFAs were required. Current site manager did best to his ability. It would of benefited from a experience site manager as a mentor to assist with specialist knowledge of works."
"JMS Plant was of a good standard .However small tools driver from KT drops off and collects plant. But does not have a book to fill out for site transfer notes. JMS small plant from Kentish town collected plant from site. Plant then approached the site to pay for the plant items collected as they could not find them in Kentish Town. We showed a piece of paper with collection signature from their driver. As above. Plant here need to be as swift at off hiring plant on the system as they are putting it on the system. Site to site transfers to be carried out for all plant leaving site, to ensure off hire dates are recorded to cover over charges of plant for srynix reports these are sent to site weekly. Hush pod on site to work throughout night to save diesel usage. Faulty equipment, confusion of who to maintain the equipment. Installation needs to be completed as per instructions. NCR plant department for any issues this is captured and must be actioned. Miss matched panels and barrier colours from the plant department. This makes the site look messy. Ensure equipment from the plant department is to a good standard and matching i.e colour of chapter 8 barriers."
" 365 transition. Caused confusion and slower processing times due to lack of training and understanding. Control of ordering, lead times etc. Detailed take offs. Take offs were inaccurate which led to increase costs due to miss read drawings. Measuring/quantifying and ordering as required. Competence of person carrying out checks this can increase costs and incur delays if quantities are incorrect. Use of click shift. Check click shift prior to ordering items on site. Items can be reused from another job for free. Checking rebar when arriving onto site. Checks to be carried out when delivery to site rebar is to be quarantines until checked. P-card are beneficial to get items to site quickly but are not controlled. Possible looking at a p-card register to track items ordered and costs? All order acknowledgements to be saved on server/sharepoint. PSC don’t understand what items are being ordered, don’t understanding high costs or long lead times. Lack of knowledge of construction or experience on site. Protecting paint work on bridge when being delivered to site. Protecting bridge to ensure less delays due to snags of touching up paint work."
 Getting subcontractors feedback to be included within lessons learnt. In future lessons learnt speak to subcontractors or provide a template form for subcontractors to provide any feedback for the project which can be discussed in the lessons learnt reviews. Getting programme etc from subcontractors prior to starting. Aspins failure How did company get through financial checks? company went bust through the project which caused programme delays and additional costs. Checking of subcontractors competence needs to be completed. Quality of brick work. Supply chain competition.
" Weekly meetings on site with all staff. QS must attend site meetings. Site cost plans must be reviewed on site weekly; all costs and works must be discussed to ensure everything is captured on cost plans. Checking against plant and labour on site is it required. A meeting must be confirmed with site teams to ensure everyone is available on site to attend via teams. More time allocated for QS to come to site once a week. Change control process. Client agreement and involved in the process. Lack of commercial presence in NWR monthly meetings. EWN to be captured and recorded, education of site management."
"Using templates that differ to MIMS ie ITP template without prior approval from MIMS. The template had intended to be used within Lot9 but was transferred to other projects as site management worked within different Lots and the document became ‘uncontrolled’. Lot 9 projects are now using the MIMS template. When starting a design look at lessons learnt library on MIMS. Can this be included within the gateway process. Site raising NCRS. Self snagging as works progressing. Snagging walk out as sections complete such as brickwork. This allowed brick work snags to be completed prior to subcontractors leaving site. Fit to finish meetings. Allow capture documentation for swift handover at the end of the project. Failing of piles by Aspin (specialist contractor). 7-14 days later realized they were not to strength. Overseeing subcontractors (i.e paint inspectors for painting works comes to site to check). Independent person checking process to limit delays and increased costs. Sample testing to be carried out. Random subcontractor testing. GRP decking surface covering was an incorrect product proposed by RAM. Has been proved to be incorrect products and change to grit resin. Product used at another project. RAM should have visits project to look at alternative and this could have been utilized to save costs. This was suggested by PM/CRE/CEM etc, other site refused."
"Welfare Cabins, as we are on site for a long duration the cabins where of a decent standard. However, it would be nice to have Air con as standard. Pest control. Prior to a project commencing have pest control come to site. Current process is having to give multiple cards to show presence on site before pest control come to site. PPE from subcontractors .Supply agency labour PPE, this can lead to increased PPE costs for the project. PPE from subcontractors Subcontractors did leave a supply on ppe on site that can be given to operatives. GRP/PASMA Towers Saving to be made when in isolations. Health and safety inspections on site Items within the inspections to be included within the site set up checklist? Items being checked against that sometime site aren’t aware of."
 Lack of space made waste management hard More items went into general waste than should have. Push back to client on more space to allow sufficient waste streams/management. Good community relations Consideration acoustic measurements carried out. Letter drops carried out and early.
"Good practice - NCRs have been recorded. Records in place and available to Group and Procurement regarding issues with RMF, MIL and MGE. Admin roles for QS and 365 taking up a lot of QS time. Senior QS starting July. Commercial Assistant starting in September to assist with Admin roles to free up QS. Financial/programme implications of lessons learnt needs to be highlighted. Possible way of improving lessons learnt process to be shared with quality and MIMS for a new form to be possibly implemented."
Booking of disruptive access in advance. Allowed scaffold to be installed at the beginning of the project. Survey completed and determined that existing paint was sound and could be overcoated with minimal ST3 preparation required. AWC paint inspector visited site and determined that the paint system was life expired for the whole structure therefore full preparation to ST3 was required. Which resulted in additional costs and time. Engagement with specialist painting inspector/advisor during design. Scaffolding was designed with 600mm clearance to OLE. This reduced the available working width on the scaffold. On subsequence design changes we were able to reduce down to 270mm to still be complaint with standards. More working room was available and better access to prep and paint and steelwork repairs. Structure was down to be ST3 we subsequently agreed with the client and AWC that we could prep the underside of the bridge platform columns and external parts of the web by jet washing to WJ4 . Better preparation to the steelwork. Faster to reduce working times. This has been taken forward on future similar works. Use of hoardings installed into the structure to segregate work from the public This allowed works to be carried out during normal hours. Help to minimise programme and costs. Non early engagement with heritage. NWR had received consents from heritage to confirm windows on staircases needed to be complaint with existing. This consent was not pass to JMS within contractual documentation. This was supplied when on site. Heritage office visits site and picked up various issues with works which caused delays and reworks. Early engagement with heritage to detail any planning or listed consents. To confirm if sample are required. Clear commercial exclusions and clarifications made it possible for us to claim for additional works and extension of time without hinderance. Good commercial negotiations and contract practice to be use again for future works.
Allocation sheets improved after workshop completed by commercial team. A better understanding from site manager why they are completing the form and the reasoning behind it. Something to be utilised on other projects.
Lack of communication with station staff prior to starting on. site. Better upfront communication with train operating company to understand closure periods. Subcontractors at times did not always adhere to programme time scales. Particularly interaction between trades. Subcontractors to attend regular progress meetings for coordination of activities.
Project succeeded throughout COVID-19 pandemic and closures due to good management and maintain standards and requirements. (Dependable project management). Not being able to self-deliver due to specialist works involved. 0 incidents/accidents on site. Due to good site management and teamwork between JMS and subcontractors. Clear standard set in place. Continuity of staff throughout the scheme. (never harm). Learning from steelwork repairs on north top flange meant a better understanding for south side top flange repairs. (continual improvement).
Weekly commercial change meetings work well. Share with wider business and carry on meeting within the LOT 9 teams. Good relationship within Lot 9 team and NWR. Keep up good relationship. NWR independent paint inspection could have been more present on site throughout the works rather than visits and beginning middle and end. Maintain good quality and continuous checks.
Trial Erection – agreed by Client to have full trial erection spanning over 5 days with all relevant parties in attendance for the erection sequence. This helped highlight any potential issues i.e. gas pipes installed as part of the erection. Achievable as work completed under provisional sum. Agree with client at tender stage the trail erection requirements. JMS would not agree to GRIP 5 -8 contract (including detailed design) due to lack of road space agreement and lack of OROR possession availability - this was a declined option due to level of Risk. Ensure when agreeing a contract that all risks are fully evaluated and ensure the risk is in line with the company guidelines. Extensive negotiation/collaboration with Bedford Council to agree suitable lane closure sequence (14 programmes to agree). Good Practice. Due to lack of scope/information forthcoming from client a number of provisional sums were include in the target costs .Good Practice.
Combination of JMS/NR/Bedford Council – sustaining pressure on stats providers to reduce outage periods to help reduce the programme .The council had more authority over the stats companies and put pressure on these companies to better their outage periods. Sub-Contractors – strong working relationship especially with subcontractors that we use regularly. i.e.. Ainscough/Attridges/Holemasters .Good practice. Sub-Contractors – forging positive new relationships i.e.. Littlewoods (crash barriers/fencing) Good company to use more in the future. Sub-Contractor – B&B Demolition – works completed well however issue with haulier towards the latter part of the demolition. Ensure contingency in place – wider access for the wagons plus extra resource if required. Cable damage whilst removing parapets. Parapets removed during OROR with reduced track protection system in place. The protection system was insufficient and a section of brickwork rolled off Track Protection and damaged cable. Removed parapets during main demolition rather than as a separate piece of work. Benefit of removing parapets pre main OROR is outweighed by the risk. Environmental savings – reduction of diesel/fuel usage by transferring from generators to a permanent power supply. Best practice. Additional compound facility adjacent to works provided - improving access as primary compound some distance away. Best practice. Design issues – 3 D modelling – better use of TOPO survey should have been observed i.e. embankment alignment. Use of all available information - not just 3 D modelling in isolation as errors can occur. Quality of site team/operatives – highly skilled and experienced team involved throughout the life of the project including a good mixture of sub-contractors/direct labour Right people allocated for the right job – reduces potential risk of issues/problems arising plus effective trouble-shooting. Strong Site Management. Civil elements – STATS diversion for example – JMS could have carried out the works better ‘in-house’ as poorly executed by external parties .Consideration of using internal JMS staff to carry out these works going forwards.
Scheme delivered 12 weeks ahead of the Clause 14 Programme ahead by 12 weeks – mostly thanks to the reduction of the stats outage periods. Additional OROR possessions assisted in reduced savings on crane hire Additional possession opportunities arrived due to the 2C scheme requirements.
Never Harm – no lost time accidents occurred during the length of the project. None but very good use of close calls on site may have assisted in this. Win-Win – working closely with the client NR to reduce the programme and ensure substantial gain to both NR and JMS. Close relationships with client help both parties.
Scheme priced on 1 x OROR possession – due to the L2C project an additional 6 x OROR possessions utilised. Utilising the additional possession helped reduce the programme. Regular ongoing progress/review meetings with Client (4 weekly progress & 2week review). Good working relationship throughout the scheme. Good Practice. Client interface proactive with regular contact by scheme sponsor. Good Practice.
TSS service to improve in all departments. Land access NR not agreed / start delayed by one day. Late contract award leading to increased price of Trak matting due to limited availability at short notice. Early contract award.
Waste management – During an Environmental Inspection it was noted that some skips/bins did not have any signage denoting what waste should be placed in them. Training of at least two Site Waste Representatives at the start of the project. ITP records were not up to date. Procurement high turn of staff .P/Os not in box.
"Six weeks additional works instructed by NR and completed within the programme. Well planned works allowed for additional works to be completed on time and in budget. Wire sawing used to obtain demolition outline worked extremely well .Expensive but money well spent – use again as a good method of working. A lot of time wasted in the planning of the job being driven by Golborne to deliver the demolition of the structure in house. Eventually decision made to not deliver in house and leave to the expert companies who do it week in week out with correct certification and training. Demolition subcontractor good performance. Really positive feedback from Senior NR management during and after demolition. Able to undertake the works over the summer period, making the most of the hot weather to improve on programme durations for planned activities. For Example waterproofing was undertaken in 1 visit rather than the standard week. Make use of summer weather where possible to undertake the works, and minimise delays."
"Project On time on budget. Excellent planning by the project team. Internal demolition – The project had been planned & priced to undertake the demolition using ‘Murphy Men’ & plant, however this was not possible due to not having the correct tickets to undertake the works. Also no NFDC membership or insurance in place to undertake demolition. Furthermore no suitable in-house plant available. To train up the JMS men to have a ‘demo gang’ who are able to be sent out over the country for the demo works. It may be possible to use this as an opportunity to open a new specialist business unit. Direct delivery of most items other than specialist sub[1]contract elements aligned with the One Murphy plan. Internal Operations, Engineering, HS, Environmental teams managing the project throughout."
"Change of NWR Staff – A change of NWR Commercial Manager has resulted in a delay to the issue of contract. Request NWR retain the same staff throughout a project, this principle can be applied to JSM staff also as this enables a smoother run of the project through to completion. NR particularly happy with how the scheme went overall. Engineering team aligned well with the NR engineering team to aid reduced timescales where programme was tight to get things over the line for site works to commence. Building and keeping the engineering team relationship is key to the delivery of the project. Being situated in the same office environment certainly improved client relationship."
"Due to arches there is a requirement to shallow lay service ducting. Whilst preparing the design drawings and ATC price, this is to be taken into account due to high risk and cost as a result of corrective action of steel pipes. Due to presence of the station platform nearby there was an issue with keeping the wire height within an acceptable tolerance due to the bridge structure. Risk-tec model carried out on the structure (others) and station platform to allow the soffit height of the bridge to be lowered to accommodate keeping the road level on the Highway above as no worse than existing. This eventually gave BBC enough justification to accept the proposals. This allowed a deviation from the NR standards for OHLE wire height."
"Contract award was delayed due to NWR negotiations and not allowing sufficient time in their programme to meet the week 05 demolition. The result of this was a large number of advanced works PMI’s being issued to progress the project. Ensure that a reasonable time is allowed within the programme for NWR contract issue, review and comment or request a ‘working copy’ form the client to enable discussions to begin earlier. Additional ORoR possesions available. Of the NCRs raised on the project, two related to lack of supervision or control of subcontractors. A further NCR relates to a misunderstood communication which resulted in levels for service ducting being set too low. Ensure that subcontractors are adequately supervised on site (Lineside) and that in future fabrication drawings will be submitted for JMS scrutiny at least one week prior to fabrication taking place (Shay Murtagh). Adequate site manager cover for when staff are on leave. Access scaffolding was subcontracted on cheapest price without sufficient regard to suitability for works. This led to working from PASMA towers and the attendant problems of ensuring they are always correctly assembled and kept fit for use. Ensure access scaffolding is sufficiently thought out and priced at outset and correctly detailed in ITT, ensuring all quotes are like for like. Do not allow financial considerations to outweigh fitness for purpose. Temporary propping system installed to maintain overall stability during deck replacement worked well and doubled up as highly useful working platform. Bear in mind for future similar schemes and consider light duty version in lieu of access scaffolds and PASMA towers if possession tie permits mprove on topo survey remit to cover project delivery requirements not just the bridge / single span rquirements. Needs to be highlighted to and taken on board by Network Rail when commissioning early GRIP stages. Asbestos found in proposed crane pad area – either not in PCIP or not noted and subsequently caused extra work and delay due to works being re-scheduled. EMP and survey only concentrated on bridge structure. NwR to liaise with local maintainer when compiling PCIP to ensure local knowledge is detailed that isn’t necessarily documents on records. Sub-Contractors programme was unrealistic for brickwork and copings to parapets install. Led to poor standard of work due to rushing to keep on schedule, remedial works and re[1]visits to clean up and re-point. See also 2.3 Use real outputs to plan future works. Allowance for inclement in future. To check subcontract against internal programmes / costs for brickwork. Parapet edge beams cast incorrectly with flat upper surface. Led to problems with aligning new brickwork to match existing. Fabrication drawings to be sent to JMS and designer for approval prior to and not after fabrication. This was raised with Shay Murtagh who have consistently declined to comment. Neither have they responded to the NCR sent to them. Ensure NCR compliance is included in Sub-Tender documentation. Wire sawing used to obtain demolition outline worked extremely well. Expensive but money well spent – use again as a good method of working. Also wire saw under side of cills to reduce time trimming up takes during demolition. Temporary works extent increased after service diversion scaffolding erected and ducts installed through parapet walls. This led to insufficient space on site and we ended up working around our own “diversion”. Must have led to massive increase in cost that wasn’t covered in target. Pricing strategy should be 6 to 8 to provide greater detail and accuracy for both NR & JMS. Monitoring proposals for the adjacent arch structure compromised of tilt sensors to assess the structure during, before and after demolition. This was a very hefty price proved. The tilt sensors were damaged during demolition in parts but still gave enough to work with particularly before the load transfer and removal of the temporary props prior to handback of the line. This was changed later down the line due to programme creep leaving not enough time to procure the other method. This was a good method in theory. First initial method was to install a flat mesh system without the sensor which would have been less bulky and wouldn’t get in the way of demolition. JMS to cover monitoring in 5 to 8 prices for all demolition of single spans in a multi-span structure. Design change of the temporary scaffold allowed the site team to install a cantilevered section of pier in certain areas other than the previously designed pier which needed extensive work to install the footings between lines. This proved to work well and get ahead of programme, also would have led to less time producing a temporary works design for the footings elements. A lot of time wasted in the planning of the job being driven by JMS to deliver the demolition of the structure in house. Eventually decision made to not deliver in house and leave to the expert companies who do it week in week out, with correct certification and training. Teething problems throughout project with utilising the MAE team as temporary works designs progressed. A lot of confusion arose resulting in loss and waste of time of engineering resource. MAE sometimes not better placed than the project team to decide on best methods to be utilised. MAE team should be involved from the start in meetings, or have a member based in the project office to understand the project better and the aspirations of the scheme. Issue arose during NR site visit when HS manager and Route director picked up that the scaffold boards across the tracks hadn’t been installed to design overlain with ply[1]board. They had the anti-slip felt applied but this had worn away leaving gaps between the boards that debris could fall through. Always install to design. Scaffold checks weekly should have also picked this up and rectified. Designer worked a sequence on the worst case scenario for structure stability units had to be lifted in and the backing adequately cured before the props could be removed. Re-visiting this analysis proved that the installation sequence could be revisited and showed to reduce programme time, in-turn gaining a pass on the QSRA for the possession to allow the works to be started with NR confident of no over runs. Scaffold design increasing from original quote Ensure ITT clearly states that the scaffold design costs covers a round of JMS comments and a round of NwR comments. Not a developing design and no additional costs will be paid until it is approved. Site team erected a temporary scaffold over live water course without consent in place. Liaise with EA advisor to ensure the EMP and consents cover the planned delivery method of works. Huge increase in costs following BBC instruction that Traffic Management had to be manually controlled throughout the project. Early engagement with Councils and 3rd party stakeholders to confirm project specific requirements."
"Able to undertake the works over the summer period, making the most of the hot weather to improve on programme durations for planned activities. For Example waterproofing was undertaken in 1 visit rather than the standard week. Make use of summer weather where possible to undertake the works, and minimise delays. NR prove difficult with some of the design approvals particularly the temporary works for the propping element and also the CAT 3 analysis of the adjacent structure during demolition works. Clearly define before the project begins the flow chart to escalate issues within NR, particularly if the DPE is refusing to sign off documents on the basis of their preference without engineering justification. Due to the sensitivity of the scheme with BBC a lot of the design elements seemed to be carried out in good faith ‘at risk’ to align with NRs aspirational programmes for demolition and installation. When the sh@t hit the fan this seemed to be thrown back in the engineering/design teams faces from NR on commercial matters when this didn’t seem to go their way. Advisable in future (as is currently done) to not undertake engineering works without full instruction and PMI in place whether or not this affects planned programme Lessons Learned document produced by CRE and SM gave NR assurances that the methodology adopted for this structure would not follow the same path as other arches that had failed during similar works. Potential to review all lessons learned (NR and JMS) on similar schemes at project start up to show how failures from other schemes will and have been averted in site planning. Leads to better reputation and client confidence. Not enough Site Manager cover during demolition works to ensure a clear handover from shift to shift. Additional site managers to stagger to the 12 hour shift rotation."
"Internal demolition – The project had been planned & priced to undertake the demolition using ‘Murphy Men’ & plant, however this was not possible due to not having the correct tickets to undertake the works. Also no NFDC membership or insurance in place to undertake demolition. Furthermore no suitable in-house plant available. To train up the JMS men to have a ‘demo gang’ who are able to be sent out over the country for the demo works. It may be possible to use this as an opportunity to open a new specialist business unit. Direct delivery of most items other than specialist sub[1]contract elements aligned with the One Murphy plan. Deliver as much work as possible with internal resource."
"Commercial management of the project has been made difficult due to the early works being PMI’d over 2 different contract numbers. The result of this has been to cause confusion over value recovery with the client and ‘messy’ internal accounting. Ensure all future advanced PMI works are included on the correct JMS project and not PMI’d to an alternate project to suit NWR accounting and administration. Change of NWR Staff – A change of NWR Commercial Manager has resulted in a delay to the issue of PMI’s and PO amendments. This has resulted in delayed payments and payments on other PO’s in the period. Request NWR retain the same staff throughout a project, this principle can be applied to JSM staff also as this enables a smoother run of the project through to completion. NR particularly happy with how the scheme went overall. Engineering team aligned well with the NR engineering team to aid reduced timescales where programme was tight to get things over the line for site works to commence. Building and keeping the engineering team relationship is key to the delivery of the project. Being situated in the same office environment certainly improved client relationship. NR & JMS joint delivery of safety brief prior to critical works Helped deliver critical works as team with all client / contractor / sub- contractors all working together. JMS & NR jointly developed and delivered detailed communications plan This help reduce the amount of public criticism and complaints as the local community was aware of the works in advance."
Gained more work since previous year including Multi Lay Utility Projects .Good standard of works and continued business development focus generated new works scopes and now will form a large part of Business Unit growth.
Gas operatives not working to approved design routes causes issues with completion/easements/redesigns of project with the Gas Transporter. Training of operatives and reiteration of importance to check trenches match the Design.
"Investing in own workforce – business unit now has 2 fully fledged Gas,Water & Cable pulling teams. Continued investment in teams promoting Murphy values of Working as a team with a family ethos and loyalty. Additional Site Project Manager to assist with operations. Mark Bailey encouraged to take new role within business unit, which will encourage teams to look at advancement themselves and know that Murphy is willing to invest in them. Shining Stars from apprenticeship scheme .Dionne Drysdale for business administration and George Brookes for Gas Operative. Scheme has been successful and business unit will be looking to encourage apprenticeship scheme in the future. Internal Murphy Labour was available for Cable Pulling that facilitated client deadlines .Awareness skills in other business units within the Group that may have labour better suited to bespoke tasks and specific requirements."
New high-top Transit vans are fit for purpose and much easier to hold required items than old IVECO ones. Encouragement to use the high-top transit vans on all of Utility Connections Fleet.
"Suppliers on hold – Radius, Fusion, Aggregate Industries due to lack of paid invoices .Reduce delays on getting invoices paid by means of actioning invoices the day they arrive and ensure all delivery dockets are to be sent in a timely manner to financial office in Golborne."
Customer feedback on customer service was less than expected. New customer focus from Project Delivery team with project coordinators now encourages a more customer focus and promotes Murphy Value of Caring for all our Customers. Estimating of projects made on assumptions that were not discussed with client at quotation stage and so generated friction during project completion. New arrangement of how tendering stage is carried out promotes customer discussions on what exactly Murphy is quoting for and what their expectations are.
"Internal Processes not robustly monitored. Introduction of own Business Unit internal audits every two months on: Estimating, Project Delivery, Completion, Planning and Finance. Start Date Notifications to Gas Transporters of programmed works were occasionally being omitted. Heavy investment on importance of SDN’s within the department and new processes incorporating weekly checks of programmed works to minimise omissions. Variations on projects from quoted scope not always paid for before works is completed. Variation process now more stringent and works stopped until variations paid."
Learning on recent electrical cable damages. Reviewed permit with H&S advisor and introduces onsite training and heightened awareness.RIDDOR received for gas operative Kirk Baxter for his slip on van step. Brief on access to vans given and also van in question was given additional anti-slip coating step. High recommendation to Plant and Transport to make this a requirement on all large vans and plant.
All good by Murphy. Issue with subcontractor TYCO for CCTV with respect to customer service and delivery. Supplier evaluation form for TYCO completed and strong recommendation to not use again.
"Exceptional foreman and team made available from Golborne office, did an exceedingly good job. Use of team again on similar project scopes."
Design from client was not clear on specifics and was open to interpretation. (3 Sets of large heavy duty doors needed) .Clarification should have been sought at tender stage rather than making assumptions.
Exceptional team from Golborne. Note to look outside of business unit and regional office to utilise skilled labour within the company.
Site’s own welfare was utilised. Nothing raised.
Fine fill was of top grade quality yet was still charged as recycled. Use of same fine fill when working in the Derby area.
Issue with subcontractor TYCO for CCTV with respect to customer service and delivery. Supplier evaluation form for TYCO completed and strong recommendation to not use again. Amptron Electrical Services Ltd. was a local electrical contractor and performed exceptionally well. Supplier evaluation form for Amptron completed and strong recommendation to be used on other projects of similar scopes.
"Omission of £150k subcontract element on Tender submission. Omission may have been due to inadequate estimating resources – project was tendered last minute. Not to be repeated on future tenders. If sufficient resources for tender submission cannot be facilitated, possibly decline to Tender. Utility Connections initially declined to Tender due to constraints provided by the client including deadlines and specific contractors to be used, we gave honest explanation when declining to tender. One week later we were invited to Tender again as Client recognised J Murphy recommendations.."
"Quality Observation (Non Conformance) raised against removal of spoil contractor ’Leedale’. Site agent spotted erroneous dockets. These were queried and not paid. Next time site agent requested spoil removal, the Buyers were aware of this QOB and so did not use Leedale."
Client has quarantined Marijuana stores on site which during warm weather was smelt all over the site. Express Medicals was contacted and confirmed there is no harm to workforce.
Spoil segregated from pedestrian and vehicular traffic areas that reduced spread during wet weather into uncontrolled areas. Professional image of Murphy was maintained and clean and tidy site was kept throughout project. Recommendation for this type of segregation to be used on other future projects.
"Invitation to Tender came about as Murphy recently included themselves on the ‘blue-light’ e-Tendering register. New business opportunities available online should be utilised and updated on a regular basis. Topsoil turned to Slurry due to adverse weather resolving inTips refusing to take waste. Estimators need to make an allowance for topsoil/Slurry temporary storage, or management as Tips refuse to. Collaboration with Murphy and the Vinden Partnership on this project was exceedingly successful. Business Development Manager to arrange discussions of other future scopes of works."
"Changes in personnel on projects. Changes in the project team at a late stage in the project from both JMS/NWR. With this scheme, the NWR SPM and NWR DPE, plus JMS CRE was either appointed late or changed throughout the project. Project change is inevitable, but it is important to ensure that handovers are completed as thoroughly as possible if/when these do occur. Excellent relationship established with local residents from early development through to delivery. JMS/NWR members of the project team actively visited those residents within the immediate vicinity the project to personally advise them of the works and potential disruption and a full letter drop was completed. Example of good practice that should be applied to all schemes. Land Access – The project was supposed to gain access in September 2019 but this was not agreed on time. JMS had submitted all documentation regarding this within the allotted timescales and NWR property had appointed WSP to complete this. The first site meeting was held in September and the required location for the compound was rejected by the landowner. Therefore, not only was the land access for the compound not the preferred choice, but the landowner had extreme demands with the rates - £1200 per week for first 14 weeks, then £3000 from weeks 14-20 and then £5000 per week after that. We required 3 separate land access agreements. The first one has been discussed above for the compound but the project also failed to secure the land access that is required to complete the Cascade elements of the scope at Codsall. WSP informed us on the 27/02/20 which caused issues as the design could not be implemented (further details in section 3.2) Ensure that land requirements are submitted within the timescales to NWR property. Ensure meetings are arranged with the appointed land agent as early as possible and any indication that the land access is unavailable should be reported ASAP. Land access should be negotiated as early as possible within the project life cycle. On certain schemes where it is known that land access may be troublesome, then it would be worthwhile submitting a second option. Due to the rescheduling of the project from September 2019 to January 2020, JMS had to subcontract these works to Podtrack. This scheme was intended to be delivered by JMS, but due to missed deadlines as a project, it caused issue with JMS resources. In this instance we had no issues from utilising a subcontractor to deliver the work and Podtrack were well managed on site by JMS, but this could have potentially caused issues and added further unnecessary risk to the project. The preference for both NWR and JMS would be for JMS self-delivery where possible."
"Scheme was re-authorised twice. Firstly, the scheme was reauthorised due to the reduced possession times which impacted the advertised possession times due to the requirement to be ‘wheels free’ 1 hour before the end of the shift due to the axel counters. Over the course of the whole programme (weekends and mid-week nights) this had a significant impact on outputs and is resulting in prolongation of the programme. There was also a small increase in scope that meant re-authority was required. The second re-authority was due to the land access associated with the cascade element of the works detailed in section 3.2 Scope should be outlined and agreed before going on site. Any changes that are necessary once on site should be agreed and documented correctly, to ensure that there is clarity between all parties and if any additional funds are required. In terms of the second re-authority, the actions followed to prevent this in the future are detailed in section 1.3 of this document. The project endured additional land costs associated with the cancellation of shifts, additional pre-lims and extension of time due to the elongation of the programme due to the failure to complete the land access. All agreements of land access to be negotiated as early as possible and the project shouldn’t start on site (if possible) until all agreements have been finalised. Axle Counter – Details in 4.4 JMS had to provide S&T cover for every shift which was unaccounted for and caused commercial implications."
"Due to the simplicity of the design, it was completed quickly and progressed smoothly through the GRIP stages. No Action required. We were unable to secure the land access that was required to complete the designed solution at the Cascade. As a result of this, JMS devised two new permanent solutions in a very quick/ efficient manner. The Smart ditch method was accepted by SAE’s and DPE’s and an agreement on the best solution for the scheme was approved in the absence of the required land access. Despite the associated costs with this, the proactiveness of the all involved with the decision making should be admired. Due to the high land access rates for the compound area, the team was under pressure to deliver the full scope of works as it wouldn’t have been efficient/cost effective to deliver these in the future. It was a tricky and time-consuming methodology that was implemented, so credit to the site team for the installation under pressure and to those involved in the decision making for doing this promptly as not to cause further delay. The drawing failed to consider falls adjacent to ditches, which created an issue on site. What was shown on the drawing, didn’t match the reality of site, so a handrail was required to installed that wasn’t previously accounted for. Designer must consider falls adjacent to ditches and ensure that these are accounted for on the drawing. This was an additional unexpected cost to the project. Minor issue with UTX levels that were resolved by amending the levels to make UTX compliant Design levels where changed to allow for the UTX to be made compliant which required slight amendment in levels with the headwalls and Cess Drainage and associated outfall connection."
"AMP Walkout – Due to the government guidelines relating to COVID 19, the AMP walkout was unable to be completed formally as the PIC stated that they were unable to visit site during this time. JMS have undertaken a walkout on completion of project and a full suite of site photos have been captured. Any issues that are realised would incur remobilisation costs and result in a change, which remains an open risk to the project / NWR. Axle Counter’s – Despite the axel counters being outside of the worksite, the scheme had issues because it was in the Axel counter zone. There was ongoing discussions with NR maintenance, but it resulted in the project losing a number of shifts. JMS had to provide S&T cover for every shift which was unaccounted for and caused commercial implications. Project had asked for maintenance support prior to starting on site, but this was not forthcoming. Before starting on site the project should ensure that NWR maintenance are engaged, or that an agreed process is approved."
"Clause 14 Programme agreed prior to site team involvement. Size of site compounds and work areas. Brickwork to liftshafts. Site Managers to be involved in the programme sequencing and durations. Due to NR client non persistence over required areas. Proposed areas not granted due to TOC reluctance, leading to costly lease of separate compound by NR, which led to scheme funding issues on final account. Access not agreed and scheme placed on hold for 2 weeks until resolved. Programme very tight for durations required due to operational platforms."
Site briefing stations utilised. Cabin Set Up Topographical surveys. Safety stations being rolled out to all sites. Good. External 32 foot cabins were utilised for the project. These offer a much better working environment for office work / meetings and for drying room / canteens simply due to more space. The overall surveys were below an acceptable standard. This led to various on site issues that could have easily been eliminated at design stage. Avoiding variation issues with NR client.
"Design Co-ordinator. Design alterations after signed off EB. There were certain issues complicated by various parties asking design related quieries:- PM , SM , Engineer , Design engineer. A singular point of contact would eliminate this issue. NR PE verbally changed various of elements of design after signed off during site visit. Notably containment to overbridge."
"Platforms. Triangular supports to lift lobbies during installation. supports for Herras fencing and 110v plug socket cabled lighting, allowed hoarding and fencing to be quickly removed during nightshifts and subsequently replaced. Issue was a bit last minute and subsequently looked last minute as well. Although fit for purpose through design. IDC had failed to pick up this issue."
"Staff .Labour. Full time Site Manager , working Foreman and Site Engineer was the correct team for the project duration and worked well with the various continuous Day / Night time working involved. Majority of works were subcontract resourced, but due to the very restricted space and the issues surrounding tactile installation cleaning up, general attendance operatives exceeded the tender allowances. Allowances for post construction work prior to lift installer commencing not allowed for. Extensive cleaning painting etc. Construction to factory environment."
"Storage of Materials very limited on Platform 2 due to compound arrangements, necessitating numerous double handling activities not allowed for. No lead time or requisitioning issues. Surplus concrete tactile after ceramic tile variation were restocked at 75% cost and transport."
PTI’s .Site Manager needs to attend all significant PTI’s.
"bar) Communication (including document control, progress meetings) Final Account. easily have caused serious issues. QS and SM requiring to re-brief 4 NR QS’s. Document control was going through changing staff and has subsequently become much improved."
"No NCR’s were issued. Generally good , except issue over RMF brickwork supervision and continuity on site. Handover information was completed but large amounts of information not clear. Specifically M+E , COMMS sections."
"Incidents. 2 x Cable stikes. Both were avoidable, all relevant paperwork in place. Defective works left by previous works by others had left live services in non acceptable conditions."
No incidents and waste was segregated where possible.
"Started to early due to pressure by NR and agreement at Pre-start meeting. It had been discussed at pre-start meeting to start early but there was no scaffold design agreed Commercial - Cost impact as Scaffold was not an agreed pre-contract cost. And not suitable for structure. Future projects to ensure commercial buy in from sub contractor scaffolders. Gauging survey required. Identify earlier when required. Base of scaffold was within 2.5m of edge of platform (2.4m) .Should have Identified to NR earlier. Loading bay could not be located where originally wanted .Loading bay to be located behind stop block. Scaffold would have to be more than 21m behind stop block which was not possible. Programme could not be worked too. Programme was for 16 weeks, completed on a bay by bay system. This could not be achieved, but the methodology was reviewed and still completed within 16 weeks."
 Site Set up. Excellent site set up with ECO cabins. ECO cabins do need more plug sockets. Roofing system. Everlast provided a alternative solution to the kalzip product. Didn’t inspect above booking office .Should have fully inspected prior to arriving on site as floor boarding was required. Crash deck .Allowed normal working hours. Crash deck interfered with installation of trunking for lighting. Put in trunking with lid facing upwards rather than downwards. Access via pop ups after the crash deck had been removed. Scaffold .Scaffold design worked well for access (Lyndon Scaffold). Paint Inspections. Didn’t have own paint inspector at time. ICS to self certify work. Network sent in Inspector and condemned the works. H&S Advisors .Regular site visits. H&S Advisors .Lack of knowledge on GB&P works.
 Design Change .Design provided by Network Rail. Design for roof was Kalzip and we changed to EuroCLAD. This was a slow process. Lighting unit spec was out of production .JMS had to source lighting unit as proposed was out of production. Change of paint system on top of purlins .JMS proposed change to paint system from 3 coat to 1 coat system to top of purlins. This aided the amount of time the it was between having the roof removed.
 Scaffold design. Was not in place when starting on site. Scaffold design was slow to be produced and issues had to be resolved. Weekly checks of scaffold .All completed.
 Labour resources .Internal Labour used who was multi skilled (Dave Patchinski). Safety Critical Staff .Garry Lewis (Site Supervisor) acted as COSS. Safety Critical Staff. 4No. CPL’s were not priced for but were required. Training. Time spent on a GB&P scheme prior to commencing work would have been a benefit. Experience .Time spent on a GB&P scheme prior to commencing work would have been a benefit. Designated Site Supervisor. Site Supervisor (Garry Lewis) worked very well as a constant supervision rather than then being moved to nights. Working constant night shifts. Night Manager found it hard with 6 weeks of constant night works.
 Roofing system acceptance .Took a long time to gain approval. Roof system had to be cut due to delivered wrong size. No impact to programme.
"TR Services. Poor performance. Design was slow and resourced well once working, but one week delay in starting from agreed start date. Everlast. Good performance. ICS. Good Commercial – Poor as ICS placed a VO for 15k due to labour loading the job (lack of works elsewhere meant their labour were not working elsewhere) and then tried to recover costs. ICS also failed to complete works (ST3 and paint) to a suitable standard and were asked to re[1]complete works. After which ICS stripped to bare metal before repainting. An item also applied for by VO. Ian Smith GRP. Cut gabble ends wrong and charged us to repair. We had no choice but had to agree to allow scaffold to be dismantled."
NR Commercial was good with monthly valuations being paid promptly and not queried.
Non conformances .Identified and completed by Site Engineer (Paul O’Conner). Paint ITP. Completed by Painters and Site Manager. Could have had more visits by ICORR lvl2 Inspectors. Clean air test. Clean air test was missed on north side of structure.
 CLAW regulations .CLAW regulations briefings would have been of benefit prior to commencing work.
Possessions (Line Blockages through GZAC).
Programme compiled without input from Chris Bird and JM Paint Inspector Programme slipped after site manager was moved to start another scheme. Gather information regarding paint spec and timescales for individual aspects of system Allow site team to complete scheme before moving/ give new site manager full site changeover as per JMS procedure.

Site cabins. Boss cabin used. Not acceptable too small for site operatives and site manager.
Original programme not realistic for size of structure/time of year Subcontractors De-veg subcontractors Gritblast &paint projects require encapsulation on all sites if at all possible to counteract weather / noise/public interface. Requirement for attendance of ptis with detailed programme for all subcontractors. Did not complete works on first visit & had to be recalled twice to complete works.-[JMS to increase supply chain for de-veg contractors.
Possession work. Cabin set up. Grit-blast .All works undertaken in possession[1]encapsulation would of reduced this. Hired cabins not up to Murphy standard-JMS eco welfare cabins to be used going forward Reliance on core JMS blast team-JMS to source GOOD quality labour supply for GBP projects-to supplement JMS team.
Design firm management. Close liaison & management of designers led to minimal design changes during construction.- [ post blast surveys to be requested ASAP & followed up.].
Staff. Full time manager/supervisor. On possessions preference would be to have a further site supervisor to provide constant direct supervision of the labour. Unavailability of JMS labour due to one night per week working.
Abraclean plan.t JMS plant. Numerous issues with plant failing on possessions leading to programme/cost over runs.-[ JMS need to tie in supplier to costs from contract set up-I.e they are to have a fitter on call. JMS need to task one operative with the clean return of plant to avoid incurring cleaning costs. JMS to undertake feasibility study for purchase /training of blast kit for future projects. Peformed well.
Paint. Paint stores to be commissioned & in use at start of project.
Linear. rmf .treefellars .VERY poor quality of operatives supplied – labour requests constantly not met.Requests to PM & linear fell on deaf ears.Linear had a take it or leave it attitude as monopoly supplier.-[ JMS to source various labour supply agencies for this type of works.] No clear foreman/supervisor for much of the works & change in staff weekly led to manger having to cover same ground with new operatives & spend time supervising. Did not complete works on first visit & had to be recalled twice to complete works.-[JMS to increase supply chain for de-veg contractors.]
"Commercial .programme. Meetings need to be held with QS & PM & SM,at least once a month as a matter of course to review/monitor cost plan. Meetings need to be held with QS & PM & SM at least once a month as a matter of course to review/monitor programme to pre-empt any EOT requirements."
"Paint finish. Not great on one side [ beam –A] as hard to make like new when using a harbon jet /paint system.-JMS to push for encapsulation on all structures,where possible to allow for full blast system to be used."
Acoustic sound barriers. Rubber mats/blocks. Waste management. Used to reduce noise from generators-[ super silent] Used to further reduce noise. No incidents & waste was segregated before leaving site.
Handover. Bright ideas. Ensure site is snag-free prior to client coming out to inspect before handover.Snagging checklist to be used in conjunction with client to provide clarity on the clients requirements. Clamp was designed & fabricated in Cannock to hold “wet end” of spray pump unit.Item sent to all GBP jobs & has been put forward as a bright idea.
"Early IDC. Subcontractor Programmes .Early meeting with Civil and M&E designers to capture cable containment and lighting placement across the footbridge, lead to a working lighting solution and supply across the bridge. Requirement for attendance of PTIs with detailed programme for all + - subcontractors. Overrun has become a problem, handrail installation."
"Rapid-setting Concrete. Due to circumstances beyond our control, site access was restricted and when it was granted once again, dates needed to be recovered. His was done through the use of rapid-setting concrete, full strength was achieved in 2-3 days, as opposed to 28 days."
"Access Design. Changes Design. Firm Management. Where it can be seen there will be changes to boundary fences, this should be picked up in design as part of the IDC process. Prior agreement with client via TQ process to alter design principles, leads to smoother financial transactions. Close liaison and management of designers lead to minimal design changes during contruction."
"Surrounding Area .When completing the temporary works design, due consideration should be taken to the surrounding area, axle’s almost overhanging excavation zone. i.e. not just position of pads, position of whole crane."
Staff .Labour. Correct amount of supervision Same staff from the beginning of the job through to the end.
"Internal Plant. Internal plant hire not comparable to external plant hire, internal plant past its usable life."
"RMF. Labour supplied was consistent throughout the job, same people start to finish. Carbon copy of timesheets. To be more detailed showing works completed by individuals."
"PTIs. Client .When conducting PTIs, request from subcontractors that a knowledgeable construction manager attends PTIs. Lack of response from the client, draw attention to the client that when a payment is submitted, if it is not responded to then we are entitled to full payment when due date arrives."
Steelwork .Anti-slip. Sequenced trial erection prior to installation. Lead to easy installation on site. Slight blistering of anti-slip at bottom section of ramp. McGraths quality procedures.
Internal Hire Cabins. Rats had been living in the cabins prior to placement on site.
"EA Notice. Photos were sent to the EA showing the job beforehand, and the job completed."
Early completion. Fencers programme. A 9 week project completed in 7 (excluding the issues with fences). Not working to the contract programme despite numerous phone calls/emails made. It was difficult to get them onsite Increase our supply chain for fencers in the rail environment
"Pre Cast bank seats. Agreed, prior to commencement to pre cast bridge bank seats – saved time of around 2 weeks."
Discontinued bearings specified in the design. Designers to ensure that all specified components are currently available since it delayed procurement.
Unavailability of JM labour Cannock region to review direct staff requirements for forthcoming jobs.
Eco-welfare cabins. Firefly Battery Pack. All welfare facilities were eco-cabins – high quality and well received by the client. Successfully trialled on site – Battery pack kicked in at night time when welfare facilities were on partial use.
Moore concrete. Good quality and on time .No external inspections carried out prior to pour.
"Littlewoods fencing .TPA/ Radius Crane Management .Asspec (Vicky Bailey) Murphy International .As per progress and programme .Good quality of service Very helpful but late issuing the lift plans. More suitable for rules of route possessions rather than outside rules of route possessions. Flexible when it comes to costs compared to Ainscough. Regular welding and paint inspections were very successful and improved quality of final product. After early teething issues, quality was very good. Utilising in-house capabilities enhances Murphy’s reputation with the client. Also keeps money in house."
Cost plan. Initial forecast cost plan had been improved – costs reduced mainly due to completing scheme early.
Steelwork. Inspections done regularly lead to a high quality bridge.
Eco-welfare cabins .No accidents or incidents .Well received & high quality .Meeting zero harm/safety culture objectives.
Use of track mats .Saved on the amount of aggregates required on the job.

" Although walked off early with minor Civils remedial works, M&E are still waiting for light fittings to be wired. Good possession planning. Possession planning was respected and was carried out without issues or incidents. 12 hrs working A lot of the work was carried out at night to mitigate men exceeding 12 hrs door to door as night shift is shorter and less traffic on M6."
"Designed both projects the Footbridge and platforms. Unfortunately the design levels, although at the same location, did not correlate. This resulted in JMS having to wait months until the correct levels were clarified. Once the levels were given it was apparent the bridge designed would not work and we then had to cut 100mm of the already fabricated column bridge supports in order for it to fit. Design for Bridge lighting gave supplier and specific model number JMS procured the lighting and after the twelve week lead time when they arrived on site they were wrong. NWR have stated the lighting spec was also on the drawing and we should have checked that the model that was given to us was the correct spec. This has resulted in a 12 week delay in handing back. The track in this region is set to absolute track geometry This means the design gave northern and eastern co[1]ordinates to set the edge of the platform .Copers in relation to the track geometry. However it was also noted in the drawing to check that the platform edge X & Y is correct. This will usually mean a phone call explaining if the track has not been moved to its absolute track geometry or it is to be moved to its absolute track geometry then the X & Y would not be as the standard and the distance and height may be too short and/or too high. IT is imperative NWR clarify the track is in the correct position or they must instruct us to work to the X & Y and not the co-ordinates."
 Design and supply RMD designed and supplied the materials for the propping to the stairs whilst they were dismantled. As using their materials the design was free. JMS erected the design very swiftly and well done to all the team.
" Hired from One call. Brilliant piece of plant. This plant has the capability to unload most delivery items and is also very versatile due to its reduced size. I am aware of several incidents with the larger telehandler, but have not heard of any with the smaller ones. JMS Requested the pick up to be booked to the site as soon as it became available. It is cheaper to hire internally than a 7.5t lorry with the benefit that nearly all can drive unlike the 7.5t lorry. It was worth its weight in gold for transferring and collecting materials, otherwise waiting for deliveries the job would have had additional delays."
 Travis Perkins. Although JMS were spending thousands with this branch they only had one delivery lorry and this would have caused problems only for the JMS Pick Up.
" Sub contractor Workmanship was very poor and they have since gone into administration. JMS electricians were called in to complete. M &E Works JMS internal electricians have although been a little more expensive, they have always delivered a quality end product. Poor quality of works JMS have had a history of problems with JA Stevenson (Tyseley, Hartford) so it may be sagacious not to use them again until their quality controls are up to standard (reliable). Good Quality Worked well dismantling footbridge with a robotic machine."
" Changes to SPM Throughout the project we had 4 different SPM’s to liaise with. Although the positive factor is the ability to strike up a good rapport with each one, the negative would be the lack of communication on Handover between them. Communication A good rapport was struck up between the site team and the TOC which served us well throughout the contract."
" J&A Stevens The Tactiles were peeling off the platform within weeks of installation. Considering the expected lifespan should be years this is very poor. J & A Stevens Considering the amount of work involved, once complete the system does not look to back. Quality management of the product was lacking throughout."
"Platform Remediation Due to JMS changing direction from the client’s proposal of a traditional platform to a GRP one, the platform heights had to be reduced. This meant the use of several skips, yet was managed well."
Northwich Festival .JMS agreed to sponsor the festival which most of the community attend This resulted in extensive local good publicity of the group.
"For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re-occurrence. Swindon team had Zero input in original programme. Delivery team need full ownership of programme. Near the start of the project, many Network Rail employees carried out several non-project specific audits per week (maximum was 13 in 2 weeks), disrupting site progress. This is because numerous NR employees live in Bristol / Bath / Chippenham area and the Chippenham project was a convenient project to visit to make up their audit numbers. JMS PM discussed with NR SPM – SPM instructed her staff that they must send requests for any audits through her. Much fewer unnecessary audits occurred after that. The number of superfluous audits did hamper progress at the start of the project but the JMS and NR managers recognised this and worked together to resolve this issue. This co-operative approach was maintained throughout the project, is a key Murphy value and should be aspired to on all projects. Also, all Project Team members should be aware of the contractual requirements and not go unreasonably beyond these requirements. Significant number of Possessions and Line Blocks were either cancelled or shortened, which caused significant delays and disruption to the programme. There is very little JMS can do to mitigate this. All lost time should be clearly captured on the Daily Report and costs chased up with Network Rail."
" CCTV towers used instead of security guards. Increased reliability (not dependant on security guards travelling to site, cameras can be controlled and viewed remotely.) Consider using on future projects. This has been 50% cheaper than the use of conventional methods. Second person checked all holding down bolts except one set, which turned out to be in the wrong location. This was due to a number of different factors, principally the fact that the designers changed the plan detail of the base plate from symmetrical to asymmetrical without updating the General Arrangement plan, meaning co-ordinates could not be checked on the total station. Always ensure additional checks are carried out by a separate Murphy’s engineer. Ensure that checks are done even if it causes delays. Because checking early would be cheaper in the long run if there is a mistake. Changes should always be fully highlighted and explained and independent checks should always be carried out on baseplates/bolt packs. CAD drawings to be requested from designers for Murphy Engineers to interrogate and utilise. There was a 100mm thick reinforced concrete slab below the tarmac on the Island Platform. This information was not available on the PCIP and there were no Trial Hole Reports for the Trial Holes indicated by Mouchel F001 stage GI. The tarmac was only circa 50mm deep so there was no possibility of using the standard 75mm thick concrete tactiles and screed/adhesive bedding without breaking out 480m of reinforced concrete on the platforms. Site Team suggested surface tactile studs to NR, which could have been installed in one weekend’s Possession. 15mm thick ceramic tactiles then had to be sourced, which were much more expensive, fragile and prone to cracking. Platform construction should always be confirmed as early as possible prior to construction at design Stage. This will then allow costs and construction methods to be captured at an early stage."
" CRE was based in Birmingham, unable to visit the site very often (circa 5 times during the project), was instructed to focus on Derby projects and left the company towards the end of the project. Project did suffer from lack of involvement. There was often a significant lag between the Project Team issuing WPPs, TWDs etc. to the CRE and them being checked/issued to NR. When the CRE left the CEM was more involved, but was often drawn into assisting with minor design issues. Given the significant time constraints on projects sufficient CRE resources should be allocated to projects. CRE were even possible to be based in the office during the delivery of the project. The Pell Frischmann’s Designer who was responsible for the Chippenham left the company in spring 2015, leaving many issues with the lifts unresolved. These were not picked up by the remaining PF Designers and were only picked up during construction. The fields below with the prefix “PF Handover” relate to this issue. A Monthly meeting should be set up between the core team, including the Project Manager, the designer and/or the QS. This is carried out in order to solve any issues and resolve further problems which have arisen from the design on site. PF Handover: No guide plates were shown on the steelwork drawings. This was detected at an IDC meeting on site by the lift subcontractor Stannah long before installation of the lifts. A design for the plates was issued by PF which showed bolted connections with raised bolt heads. JMS Site Team questioned this but Stannah confirmed they would be ok. Plates were requisitioned and installed, which should have solved the issue before installation. However, when on site, the lift installation team stated that the bolt heads would foul the running lift car. The bolts had to be removed and welded, causing a delay to the installation of the lifts. A weld inspection showed that the welders had not welded the plates correctly, often spot welding instead of continuous fillet welding the underside face. A different welding subcontractor was called in to resolve this issue and re-weld the plates. All this would have been avoided if the plates were included on the original drawings and welded in the fabrication yard. Small items such as plates should be checked for at design stage. Details such as this will be easily noticed by people who have worked on AFA schemes. Stannah and the CRE should be involved earlier in the design. This will ensure that any details which may be missed by the site team will be picked up by more experienced members of the team, in any drawings. Get Stannah to review the drawings and enquire whether they could confirm(in writing) if they would be able to build the design before the drawing go to AFC’s PF Handover: The 4No doors for the lift entrances were clearly shown on the Stannah drawings as being side opening. However, the PF steelwork drawings showed the doors centre opening. This was noticed by the lift installers after the majority of the blockwork had been installed around the lift doors. TQ was raised on this matter but had failed to be reflected on the drawings The designer’s drawings should be sent to Stannah at an early stage of the design process so that it can be compared with their original design. CRE make sure that any TQ’s are implemented into the designs, and any AFCs or As Builts."
" Land and Marine Temporary Works Design team (JMS in-house TWD team) produced TWDs. These included: Heras & solid hoarding fencing calculations; crane pad design; stability during bridge dismantling; shuttering for lift shaft (sacrificial sheet piles); support to trestle foundations on Island Platform; All Temporary works should be kept in the immediate team. Where this is not a possibility, due to our engineering team being overloaded, then the Land and Marine temporary works team should be utilised. Cost of this was very high, ranging up to a value of 20,000. This could have been avoided if the in house Engineering team was used. Using this method also caused a small number of delays, as waiting for the temporary works meant work could not be done on site."
" The labour for-caster was not used to its full effect, resulting in a number of poor or inexperienced workers arriving on site. Using the labour for-caster a number of weeks in advance so that the right people can be acquired. In this way, you can ensure that workers will stay on the job longer. Project won and retained the STAR Award throughout the construction / commissioning phase. This gave a boost to all the site team. There was significant variations in the quality of Site Supervisors on this project. Kyle Jones has to be recognised for his willingness to get the required work done, his construction knowledge, and his awareness of Network Rail’s Safety Critical processes due to being a Adherence to the WE CAN DO values on sites should be led by the Site Staff, but more importantly by Site Supervisors, who should act as role models for the Operatives on site COSS. Others variously lacked confidence to drive the works ahead, had incredibly negative/aggressive attitude, to being obstructive and impassive. Engineer had to carry out all setting out works at variousprojects, which led to some of the issues later in the construction phase. Take a realistic view of current and projected workloads and plan to have sufficient resources in place to meet these. During the course of the project there were several occasions when there were day and night shifts. Engineer stayed until 20:30 to provide a handover with the night shift and the Site Manager came in early to provide the other handover. Alternative would have been to leave notes and telephone calls, but it is much better to have face-to-face discussions and show progress/issues. Face-to-face handovers should always occur whenever possible."
"Murphy International did not order block and tackle on installation shift 4. Therefore they could not adjust the angle of the deck much so spent a long time hammering in bolts. Ensure sufficient equipment is identified and ordered in advance. Combination locks were used for access gates to the compounds, which prevented delays due to Operatives having to fetch keys to open padlocks. Use combination locks on other projects. Engineer brought in his old laptop and this was set up in the Briefing Room, connected to a projector and used for site inductions, briefing the Lift Plan on crane weekends etc. This is something that the project was commended for by Network Rail, Murphy and other companies visiting the site. Old laptops or PCs should be provided to sites for issuing briefings to give a more professional appearance."
" Since processing of requisitions has moved to Golborne from Cannock the processing time has increased. Also, Order Numbers could be got quickly from Cannock but now take a number of days. The order of materials should be made a week or two in advance. Materials should be chased up to make sure that it is arriving when it is due to be on site. Innovation –LED handrails. The Buying department sourced a cheaper buff forticrete blocks alternative which had a shorter lead-in time. The materials specified should be examined at as early a stage as possible and opportunities for similar, lower cost alternatives should be examined. Later in the project integrated copers and tactiles were found in a web search. These could have been suggested to Network Rail as an innovation, which would have also evened out the significant irregularities in the platform surface. Website is: http://www.g[1]techlimited.co.uk/specification.htm These integrated copers and tactiles should be suggested as an improvement/innovation to NR in the tender stage. Black Rhino tiles with contrasting yellow edgings were used to quickly and safely bridge the existing platform surface and the temporary surfaces on the Island Platform. This removed the time delay of installing temporary tarmac at the end of each Possession shift. Rhino tiles are an economic and effective means of ensuring a safe walking area for passengers and could be considered on other similar projects. Network Rail asked for confirmation that the grout to be used by the JMS subcontractor UPAC in the piles was non shrink, as specified in the design. We contacted the suppliers, Lagan Cement, who supplied a statement and product information stating that cementitious grout is non shrink by nature. The only differentiators in practice are high/non high strength and rapid/non rapid setting. This clarification was useful and the response from the cement supplier was very quick."
" Pell Frischmann performance extremely poor. Do not use Pell Frischmann on future schemes. UPAC – Operatives supplied were very competent and eager to get works completed, but their management was very contractual. Also, their pile design was very conservative and would have significantly increased the piling costs. In future do not allocate pile design to pile subcontractor. The M&E works were split amongst many small subcontractors (CCTV = Optyma, LED handrail lighting = Chromatica, cable installation = RB Evans, deck lighting = DW Windsor). This meant there were several interfaces and companies to be chased up. Better if one larger company could be given the M&E contract. Stannah installed all the lift equipment and performed well. Use Stannah on other projects where lifts are to be installed. Time lapse footage was very interesting and good promotional material. Time lapse cameras should be considered on other large projects."
" Swindon team had zero involvement in tender submission Delivery team needs to have input into tender. Poor cost control and cost forecasting from site team Site manager to take ownership of cost forecasting and use new cost control template. As on their other projects, FGW (then GWR) held weekly on site meetings. This was to keep up to date with work activities and interfaces. Some NR personnel also attended regularly and it was good to keep on top of current items and not let things slide. This should be encouraged whenever feasible. The Chippenham project was a North project (F001, F002 etc.) but then handed over to Swindon at relatively short notice due to the southern location and other workload. Much information and expertise was therefore lost in the transition of delivery times. Same delivery team should be used for the design and construction phases to prevent this loss of information. Slight confusion by Network Rail SPM near the start of the project – assumed new station signage was in the JMS scope of works. This is always Network Rail’s responsibility to organise with the TOC. NR did arrange for their sign subcontractor (Rydon Signs) to carry out the work. JMS personnel to be aware of contractual requirements and not agree to items of work that are outside our scope. At the start of the Construction Phase, NR PM requested that the Daily Report be issued to NR in the format stipulated in the contract. This was significantly different from the template JMS uses for all NR projects. After some discussion between NR and JMS it was agreed we would continue to use the JMS template. Matters such as this should be discussed with the Client directly and agreement should be reached."
" Site Team compiled the Health & Safety File as the works progressed, which helped complete it at the end of the project. Health & Safety Files should be compiled as the works proceed. A number of mistakes had been made by both the Murphy team and subcontracts. NCR’s need to be raised over the mistakes which has been made by both Murphy team and subcontracts."
" There was an incident on site involving two members of the site team working within the 1.25. This was investigated by network rail and Murphy’s Health and Safety. This resulted in a number of actions which had to be implemented by the site team. A site warden or site keeper should be used on station platforms whenever work is being carried out. Safe work limits should be indicated in site inductions, and reflect that it is a live station environment. Four uncharted electrical cables (including one HV cable) and five uncharted pipes were discovered by the site team, but due to safe digging practices always being employed no service strike occurred at the project (as of 02- 12-15). The Site Team was highly praised for this and this should be encouraged on all projects. Feedback Friday session initiative commenced during the project. This was successfully set up and maintained by the Project Engineer and certain Site Supervisors. This was beneficial for keeping the Site Team updated on activities and gain their feedback on issues. This was also commended by Network Rail as being another example of Murphy’s commitment to Health and Safety. Feedback Fridays (or alternatives such as Teamtalk Tuesdays, Thoughtful Thursdays) should always be held on projects."
" Site Team worked with Network Rail team and donated redundant timber from sheet pile frames to local football club. Good community engagement and prevented some waste going to landfill. All projects should aim look at similar opportunities. Very few sustainability opportunities were available at this station (brown field site, contaminated land etc.). Before projects commence sustainability opportunities should be examined."
"Hot Works Permits, Permits to Dig etc. were titled the date of issue (not 1, 2, 3 etc.) which meant they were self-indexing. This meant that if an operative accidently held onto a Permit until after a new one was issued the index list could be quickly and easily updated. This could be rolled out on other projects. Engineer noted Lessons Learned (positive and negative) throughout project. This meant that lessons were captured as the project progressed and prevented items being forgotten. All project teams should record lessons when the project is progressing. Worksite space was very limited and was an issue throughout the project. This is because all worksite space came from either the car parks to the north and south or the actual platform surface on the Island Platform (the derogation granted on the Island Platform was only 2.1m from the edge of the platforms; marginally larger than the extents of the foundations on the Island Platform). This meant the worksites were always very constrained and congested. Network Rail recognised this and searched for nearby land that belonged to them. They found some land they owned in the “£3 car park” a few hundred metres away. This helped to alleviate some of the space issues and was used a lot during the course of the project. Such opportunities to use Network Rail land should be examined for future projects, especially on station projects. used a lot during the course of the project. Such opportunities to use Network Rail land should be examined for future projects, especially on station projects. -ve then +ve During the course of the project, while tracing an uncharted cable, Network discovered that they owned a small room that was one of the station buildings on the south of the station. NR allowed JMS to use this room free of charge as a Site Office when the main compound was demobilised (meant JMS only had to hire in a small canteen/toilet groundhog unit). Although the room was very small it was sufficient for a temporary Site Office. Such opportunities to use Network Rail rooms should be examined for future projects, especially on station projects. A map of the station with the postcodes of both sides of the station was put on a notice board in the office. This meant that the postcode for the correct side of the bridge could be used in Requisitions and the items delivered to the storage area on the correct side of the station. Similar maps could be used on all bridge projects. On this project the site was divided by the tracks and the station, while on road bridge projects the site is divided by the removed road bridge between demolition and installation of the new deck."

Proposed Site Managers should have an involvement in preparation of the Contract programme Lengthy discussion on benefits of issuing a very aggressive clause 14 programme to generate EOTs against.

Limited value in accelerating the Clause 14 against tender durations AS BUILT PROGRAMME ATTACHED Designers failed to identify surface mounted troughing, which conflicted with the proposed column locations. This was realised on site set up when the structure was set out. The result was an extensive delay whilst the design was revisited and amendments made. Design Programme Attached for reference. The design delay was compounded by the later identification of buried troughing conflicting with a revised column location. The resultant delays in design completion also had the knock on effect of pushing installation dates into weeks where limited possession opportunities existed."
Site Briefing .Stations Cabin. Set Up Topo Surveys. Engineering Control. Excellent use of Safety Stations in site compound complete with corex sequencing displays. Safety Stations are being progressed through the Bright Ideas Forum Adequate for Contract It was noted that topo surveys are generally not as accurate as expected and any stations provided by topo teams are not accurate enough for setting out from. Engineers to attend site during topo surveys and ensure a FULL Station check is completed PRIOR to starting any permanent works Murphy did not attend trial erection. A Murphy engineer or site manager MUST attend the trial erection. Column bolt clusters were set out incorrectly. Co[1]ordinates given on drawings were incorrect – refer to topo survey comments. Engineering errors out of tolerance. Better cluster design required. Zero tolerance for error allowed with welded cluster design. Should be reviewed by site team at F003 stage. CREs to discuss setting out concerns with engineers before approval. Engineers did not identify incorrect co-ordinates on TQs and resolved between themselves without documenting errors. This caused confusion with rest of construction team.
"Design Co-ordinator .Design Resource. Project Team leading design. Permanent Works Design Errors. Design Information for Piling Contractor. There was a lack of a single point of contact for designers. CRE, Site Manger & PM all had involvement with design PM. Going forward, the design co-ordinator reporting to the. Murphy PM should control all correspondence and liaison with regular two weekly meetings at designers offices where appropriate. Designers to provide resource to complete design on all schemes in any package of works concurrently. It was noted that in Package 3 (Didcot was one scheme of three) the designers planned to use a single design resource. Any delay in one design then impacted the other two schemes. Going forward all schemes should be designed concurrently and appropriate resource provided. All float should be linked after design activities. Tim Cooney to investigate options for linking design deliverables to LDs. Bringing design into the Project Manager’s responsibility worked well. Design co-ordination is still required, but the design co-ordinator should report through the implementation phase PM. This allows for better vision of the main programme and critical activities. F003 was signed by CRE with visible surface mounted troughing conflicting with proposed column locations. CRE MUST visit site with drawings prior to sign off. Consulting engineers advised of error in design and delay costs attributed to consulting engineers. Early site visits advised for design team & liaison with construction team. Design review meeting proposed for future schemes with Consulting Engineers, Murphy Project Manager, Design Co-ordinator and CRE prior to issue of F001/F002 & later for F003. Information provided for piling contractor was deemed to be insufficient by subcontractor designer and when information was provided the subcontract design failed to meet criteria to pass the CAT III check without significant discussion and revision. Liaison between Designers and subcontract designer was very poor and Murphy CEM/CRE involvement was also very poor with no party identifying an effective quick resolution. Refer to design programme for evidence of delay in design process for piling. To improve for future schemes, it is suggested that subcontractors continue to design the piles, but the subcontractor does this in conjunction with the permanent works designer. Any issues with proposed reinforcement, size of pile etc. should be agreed at design stage and the CAT III check should be completed immediately after by the permanent works designer. It is proposed that the subcontract designer attends the permanent works designer’s office to complete the design."

Suggest using larger piling companies with in-house design capability. Slow to pay operatives resulting in lack of motivation and productivity. Over 30 inductions recorded for minimal piling works – clearly unacceptable Over inflated variations submitted to attempt to recover losses attributed to reasons stated above. Refusal to accept fair and final offer presented by Murphy to finalise the account and no recognition of poor quality of personnel provided on site. Very positive client feedback received.

"Site Briefing .Stations Cabin Set Up. Topo Surveys. Murphy Influence in Design Decisions & Outcomes. Edge Beams. Tolerances. Lifting. Fixing Reinforcement Steel. It was noted that topo surveys are generally not as accurate as expected and any stations provided by topo teams are not accurate enough for setting out from. Engineers to attend site during topo surveys and ensure a FULL Station check is completed PRIOR to starting any permanent works Centre of gravity was not central resulting in an overturning moment being applied to teh PC edge beams in their natural state. This made them difficult to handle, lift and install. Centre of Gravity must be considered at design stage and edge beams designed to rest flat on horizontal ground. Use of Dywidag connectors to connect the deck reinforcement to the edge beam reinforcing steel was difficult to connect. Use this system on the centre of the structure, but not for edge beams. trying to line up the edge beams with the bottom mat reinforcing was very time consuming. REFER TO SKETCH FOR CONNECTION DETAILS Tolerances need to be increased for major items of the deck structure. Too much time is wasted in possession trying to get large heavy bulky items to site within very small tolerances. Designers to be made aware on future packages and tolerances to be increased The design incorporated lifting points on all major parts of the new deck structure and this enables the crane oprators to hook on without having to change rigging between lifts. This worked very successfully. Main lifting steels for internal deck steel were fixed at an angle following the abutments (on a skew). These need to be fixed square so that there is no adjustment of 4 leg chains required. Note to be considered on next packages Murphy did not attend trial erection and the point above was not identified until the main possession. A Murphy engineer or site manager MUST attend the trial erection. CRE MUST meet crane lift supervisor and site manager on site to review all lifting ahead of main possession. CRE did not do this at Duffiled and we had a temporary works problem that could have been resolved ahead of the lift if the CRE had been aware of the planned works in advance. Corrugated deck sections to be supported with steel plan bracing ahead of any future lifts Fixing bottom mat steel for the deck at the precast yard was very useful and significantly reduced post lift construction works Fixing together bottom mat steel across teh deck with dywidag connectors in the centre worked very well. This should be repeated on future schemes. Links from the end of the edge beams and deck clashed with steel links protruding from the edges of the precast approach units. This needs some detailed investigation at design stage and a formal review of sequencing and how the items will fit together."

Communication. Link with Site Team. Scaffolding vs Combisafe. Design Delivery. Subcontract Design. Prioritisation. Temporary Works designs ‘worked up’ together with Network Rail DPE. Excellent communication maintained throughout design process resulting in much improved sign off periods Link between Site Manger and Design Team was sometimes remote and site manager notified designers that they were unhappy with elements of the design after design development. This resulted in creating urgent revisions that were completely avoidable. Designers to liaise with site teams prior to commencing design. Site managers to ensure that construction concerns are highlighted early in the process. Clip on combisafe was used as edge protection following installation of the new edge beams. This avoided any requirement for scaffolding to the outside of the new structure and can be fixed as standard edge protection or to include an external walkway and edge protection Design delivery from scaffold company was extremely poor. Use of external design provider. Created critical path delay in design delivery. Tim Cooney to investigate ways to manage delivery using LDs. Temporary Works Team were very reactive. Urgent minor works requirements jumped queue resulting in creating a back log of scheme designs causing all to become critical at a later time. Steve Burrows to look at design delivery programmes and to ensure appropriate resource is available. Temporary Works team used separate register to project team and they did not match.
"Staff. Labour. Full Time Site Manger, working foreman and Engineer was the right team for the duration Increased labour levels employed beyond tender allocation. To be fed back to Estimators (Simon Mullaney)."
Murphy equipment is still not comparable to external hire equipment. The objective is to be comparable to an external hire company so there is some way to go. Plant returns are not being updated in a timely manner. Tim Legg to investigate and propose solutions going forward.
GRNs .Jamestown & Shay Murtagh .Tickets were scanned and copied to Golbourne. This has drastically reduced the number of lost tickets that cannot be matched to invoices in Accounts The combination of using Shay Murtagh for the precast edge beams and Cill beams and Jamestown for steel worked very well. The two companies work very closely together and both offered good value when compared to alternative quotes. Shay Murtagh provided steel fixers to fix bottom reinforcement steel in their yard.
Mostly Direct Labour Utilised. V&G. PTIs. Subcontract Review Forms. Take it or leave it attitude as monopoly supplier of a narrow base system for bridge parapets Finish is not acceptable for pedestrians on footpaths adjacent to barriers and the parapet requires extensive modification. This must be captured in PTI ahead of works progressing and fed back to estimating team. Site team to feedback on evaluation forms. Site managers MUST attend key subcontract PTIs going forward to understand scope and programme. Durations and call off periods MUST be entered into PTI minutes and form part of the subcontract contract. To be issued in all cases to buying.
Client Feedback. Commercial .Programme. Very positive client feedback received. Final PRISM Score was 4.85 from 5. All variations discussed with project team as they occurred and values agreed in principle. Timely close out by commercial and PMIs received. Excellent visibility each month of agreed value associated with change controls. No EOT required. Project delivered on time. Possession works delivered 9 hours ahead of schedule.
NCRs .NCRs raised against Crash Barrier. V&G not very helpful in resolving. No other quality issues reported and project closed out with zero revisits to complete latent snagging All NCRs to be documented and recorded within the region going forward. NCRs to be logged on subcontractor evaluation forms for any recorded against their works. (Post meeting note: it is possible dome TW valve covers have been covered with surfacing in the footpath. Site team to investigate).
Incidents. STAR Award. 1 x HV strike 1 x Telehandler falling to the side Client feedback on reaction to incidents was positive and perception was that significant learning had been communicated throughout the business following each incident. Use of Air Lance around services Safe Digging Practices + CAT & GEnny Course rolled out across Region Duffield received the Network Rail STAR Award for HSE.
Incidents .Erosion Blankets. SWMP. No environmental incidents recorded Good use of erosion blankets on embankment reinstatement Site team encountered difficulties inputting into smartwaste because Suppliers were not being updated into the system by the administrator. Tim Legg to discuss timely updating with administrator and determine why there is such a time lag from request to implementation.
"Appreciation .Labour Rates & Lodge. Note of thanks expressed from Tim Legg to site team for delivering on time and within budget .There still exists disparity across sites with lodge & travel payments, plus some uncertainty as to when to pay double shifts or minimum single shifts for overtime or weekend working. Tim Legg & Pat Smith to roll out consistent approach to rates & lodge to all Site teams."
Start dates to be reviewed .Grit blast & paint schemes would better serviced if start date is coming into warmer seasons-JMS to discuss with client.

Handover. Ensure site is snag-free prior to client coming out to inspect before handover.Snagging checklist to be used in conjunction with client to provide clarity on the clients requirements.
Original programme not realistic for size of structure/time of year .Gritblast & paint projects need the programme to be written and to take into account weather & a realistic view towards completion. It cannot be written on an eventuality that has not occoured or wishful thinking causing a higher risk of accident due to additional pressure that is already in place. A risk register should be in place prior to the start at works incorporating all residual & primary risks associated with the project which in turn will govern the programme. Management time & a clear understanding of roles/ responsibility & or even training for new starters to completely understand the companies procedures & policies. Adequate staffing in place to prevent fatigue for all staff therefore maximising output. The CPP is not a clear brief on the scope of works. Although well written it does not outline clearly the Client expectations. Prior to commencing any site works at the initiation stage the construction activities and methodology needs to be pre-planned & thought out. Possession planning – 5 months to gain access to city lines too commence works. To identify sidings it was suggested “ site manager walks along the rail to find out who owned it as he only works 4 nights a week”. D Challinor quote.
Possession work .Cabin set up. Grit-blast. Too much time spent mobilising worksite. Hired cabins not up to Murphy standard-JMS eco welfare cabins to be used going forward Reliance on agency blast team-JMS to source GOOD quality labour supply for GBP projects-to supplement JMS team.
Design firm management. Close liaison & management of designers led to minimal design changes during construction.- [ post blast surveys to be requested ASAP & followed up.]
Staff. Full time manager/supervisor on days to conduct office hours site business along with a labour operative to do the necessary running around. On possessions preference would be to have a further site supervisor to provide constant direct supervision of the labour.
Abraclean plant. JMS Plant .Numerous issues with plant failing on possessions leading to programme/cost over runs.-[ JMS need to tie in supplier to costs from contract set up-I.e they are to have a fitter on call. JMS need to task one operative with the clean return of plant to avoid incurring cleaning costs. JMS to undertake feasibility study for purchase /training of blast kit for future projects. Scaffold – avoid GRP on paint jobs and protect lighting with pallet wrap. Performed ok minus changing orders and updating plant returns.

Linear. Rmf. JSB. VERY poor quality of operatives supplied – labour requests constantly not met.Requests to PM & linear fell on deaf ears.Linear had a take it or leave it attitude as monopoly supplier.-[ JMS to source various labour supply agencies for this type of works No clear foreman/supervisor for much of the works & change in staff weekly led to manger having to cover same ground with new operatives & spend time supervising. Not all labour force have a clear understanding of English. Isolation times governed to suit themselves. The whatever is easier attitude. No assistance provided.

Programme compiled without input from Chris Bird and JM Paint Inspector. No possessions booked prior to work commencing. We had to work using line blockages Programme slipped after site manager was moved to start another scheme .Gather information regarding paint spec and timescales for individual aspects of system. Book possessions within planning timescales prior to work commencing. Allow site team to complete scheme before moving/ give new site manager full site changeover as per JMS procedure.
Site compound. Site access track. Very good site compound set-up Aluminium track way inaccessible during icy conditions. Use alternative to metal during winter.

Site cabins. ECO cabins used.
"Call bedding mortar 1:3 please stop using skips. 1 tonne bags (disposable) are so easy to use and can be all filled in advance as demo is being completed. Fortunately our mortar consumption was low due to accurate pre cutting but could easily be four times as much. Tonne bags can be supplied with discharge chutes Signing in on arrival is your start time; therefore early arrival for briefing encroaches into 12hr limit. For restricted access sites clear understanding of size and manoeuvrability of plant to be understood by all. This may mean trimming trees and reinforcing highway verges. Major loads i.e. ballast and p.c delivery wagons reversing in need 2 Banks men in radio contact with driver. Telephone number of heavy recovery contractor would be useful. Note Ballast wagon tractor unit (external hire) was not fitted with front tow, draw bar all other Ainscough trucks have this accessory. Unloading precast - off loading area for p.c delivery trucks needs to be level in both planes x-x and y-y. This avoids re checking chains and clashing units. Coring of dowel holes as continually advised is incredibly slow these are best rock drilled with machine mounted rig takes seconds not hours. Ample protection of cable troughs in trafficked areas[1]Lids at end of ramp damaged Skips will continue to be used. Tonne bags are not designed for multiple lifts. Skip bags are very useful for pre mixing & filling mortar skips. All SACCS to sign in guys at shift times, not arrival times. Noted Aim for a compound sufficient to be able to turn wagons around. All major delivery suppliers to provide numbers of heavy recovery vehicles on standby, or that could be made available. Larger compounds required 70x 50 min or separate parking for big weekends. Feedback to pre cast suppliers. Notify them of off loading capability ahead of units be loaded in their yards. Investigate with rock lift potential solutions. Agreed.Temp edge protection / access scaffold and similar to be removed well clear of demo zone. Attachment resulted in some unintended removal of masonry. Abutment wall edge protection scaffold - ensure at least 150mm offset to allow for clips and Cill over sail. Hand Back Engineer - This is a new constrain imposed by NWR on schemes where track support not potentially disturbed?? Multiple crane configuration, crane pad very good provides for change. Site lighting for night possessions was excellent. Ply cut and drilled to correct height for screed levels saved time. Access ramp to track level worked well for installing crash deck. Engineers available on opposite shifts with a good understanding of the works. Edge protection along wing walls and abutments was very good. (Allow extra labour as task was time consuming) Machine coring a lot quicker than hand held units suggest this is to be specified on future ITT's. Authorised Embankment access needed to be created to work area on top of wing walls. A rat run was fenced off from use but operatives opened the fence and continued to use it Access to back of abutments. (Combi safe stairs to be on site for access ) Grouting of Cores- Is it possible to use only ready mixed/tub grout as this process is time & labour intensive. Keep edge protection well clear of demolition. Noted Noted Use on future schemes. Noted Adopt as standard practice. Noted Noted Need to have 1 team per abutment, minimum of 4 scaffolders on each shift. Make shortest route the access route. Look in to sourcing ready mixed grout."
"Better understanding of requirements to be understood by all, this is particularly relevant to Designers and their translation on to the drawing showing construction sequence which should be embellished further. Advance trial holes and intrusive structure investigation. The arch was indeed saddled as suspected by JMS and advised to NWR at the QRSA, but not identified by NWR or consultants despite presence of tie bars and pat tress plates. The removal of the saddle is an extra to the contract but if we had not had an appropriately experienced demo contractor in place results could have been different as saddles need to be removed in advance of masonry arch in order to control collapse. This same issue applies to the wing walls. Had the road closure been in place as required we would have had prior knowledge of the H4a parapet foundation requirements. Related to 2 above as the abutment core was random rubble stone not brick/ stone hence the dowel grout consumption was far greater than anticipated. Sufficiency of the materials, on site need to be considered. Issue for Designers details really and spec. 1:3 bedding mortar does not need to be non shrink it is under compression. Con Arch 'bearings' which are only joint separators, do not need adhering to Cill or Con Arch an unnecessary operation. Joints between con arches use Servisised closed cell polyurethane core. Have multiple sizes on site as joints can vary 10mm to 60mm. The saw cut to the correct level for demolition was a must. Advance over dig of abutments prior to possession not in line with intended methodology. This operation prevented tracking of demo excavator over arch for later recovery by crane. Detail of back of abutment drainage & approach units to be reviewed for build ability for future schemes. Create more detailed sequence drawings for permanent works as required. NWR should be made aware of the constraints as opposite. Archive Drawings to be prepared by NWR. Greater understanding of Grip 3 reports by all parties. NWR to provide archive drawings. Site managers to order extra materials for possessions, e.g. to make allowance for voids Noted Capita to review Capita to review sealment material for future projects. Pre demolition cut survey is a must. Any hazards associated by abutment stability to be highlighted, by the permanent works designer. Internal temp works teams to check abutment stability pre demolition. Consider going to proposed cut line, but consider separately for each structure. More detailed sequencing to be considered by permanent works design."
"Service bridge - S and T cable located on to JMS Scaffold Bridge by NWR maintenance - needed to be located on remote side of scaffold and better protected Service Bridge where possible to be erected further away from structure Abutment stability checks as noted in design, now to be managed & controlled internally. Review protection prior to possession. Split ducting where necessary. Noted Better control of back of abutment works."
"Resource provided at Ladbrook considered to be the optimum numbers. If we need to draft in agency labour, suggest bringing in for 2 shifts, ahead of the major possession."
"Lifting clutches - assume note supplied by precast concrete supplier as a way of ensuring they are on site. Lifting clutches were not delivered on time. This was resolved but could have been very embarrassing. Pre possession checklist needs to be carried out before the possession. Parapet Beams were cast in the wrong colour. Reinforced steel, shortfall in delivery. Note not all suppliers will supply lifting clutches. Noted Noted, Rob Gray to find checklist. Need to ensure that the drawings are detailed if colour is to be included. Need to develop an inspection & test sheet when inspecting concrete. Feedback to buying department."
"Communication - Ensure radio communication is available to Banks Man inside demo exclusion zone from outside. Allows JMS staff to give direction or convey observations to demolition staff. JKI – Core Sub Contractor- Gas powered generator in use on track. Must be used on future schemes, These need to be banned from all JMS sites. We were unaware of their use prior to works & so leaved us exposed should anything arise, also if not in paperwork-WPP, fire action plan etc, then exposure is double barrelled."
"Pre possession hub day. Site compound set up and information posters were good gave a very professional approach to the whole weekends work. Trail assembly prior to works so that all con arch unit positions were pre marked on the cill beam allowed a quick installation time. Staggered Site Management handover times works well. CRE on site to amend WPP as works progressed. Utilising JMS on call fitter to control access in and out of site worked very well. Site Access Control team that were not involved in the actual works, worked extremely well signing 162 operatives in and out of NDS247. 2-way radios FROM REMOTE GATE TO SITE, worked well site managers were informed of NR visitors to site. The correct labour skills and experience on the shifts to carry out the works. Exclusion zones and NR viewing area was well received to keep operatives and visitors segregated form high risk works. Pre possession attendance check. ( 2no operatives attended site with no TVP this had to be resolved on the night ) One of the biggest things to take from the weekends works was that every hurdle that was put in front of us as a team we dealt with each one without panic with a cool and measured approach. This I believe installs confidence from the NR delivery team that the JMS works will be completed to a high standard without fuss. Well done to all. Compound size inadequate at peak operations. Car parking needs to be in wholly separate area. Works very well, use on every site. To be used as best practice on GWEP by NWR. Recommend trial assemblies on all projects. Note Absolute requirement. Use again going forward. Worked really well, outstanding. Photos to be attached of the office set up for briefings. To use again on future sites. Recommend use on all sites. Noted Noted Look in to getting TVP access to rail compliance. Superb effort by all involved."
"Delay in issue of F003 / AFC drawings. Designers to issue drawings on time. Work back from critical timelines to give designers deadlines for submissions. Delay in signing off revised retaining wall design once it was finally agreed to install resulting in extended contract period. NWR differed in opinions of what was required following JMS TQ early in project. Delay in agreement resulted in unnecessary increase in the required methodology at a later stage to install the retaining walls – limited access, road open to public etc. Delay with crane works – NWR delay in signing of the WPP resulted in cancelled weekend lifting operations .NWR to review the amount of time they have to review documents – requiring full acceptance 21 days before the works are due to start is overly restrictive, along with the requirement to submit TW at the same time for fairly standard operations. Coper Installation on site – multiple issues with design & quality . Programme could be reduced by having Shay Murtagh’s install the Copers as far as practicable. Far easier to install in factory than on site. May not always be practicable due to increased weight of main spans. Trial installation of copers must take place and number sequence to be improved to aid installation on site if they are not pre installed. Quality of PCC units .More time required for manufacture of units – last minute rush will always result in poor quality. Need to confirm how much time fabrication requires and allow for it. Also applies for delivery to site to ensure we have units for lifting / checking."
"Good Site establishment – maintain and improve using best practise ideas on next site. Security – Issues with quality of service, different guards all the time, poor timekeeping and lack of patrols from some. Unable to monitor that patrols were actually being carried out.Surveying Setting out .Lack of designated Site Engineer – split between three sites is not good enough. Sam Z is a topo eng and not a construction eng – little experience of actually building / sequence requirements as far as I was concerned – unable to make decisions relating to actual construction requirements / forward planning and sequence. Construction method .General build methodology was good. Limited access to West abutment slowed progress on site. Limited to possession works for moving materials and plant. Limited access restricted operations, sequence and methodology available to possession works. Inspections .Fabrication inspections by Vicky Bailey. SM should attend at least once during fabrication to discuss any issues and look at the bridge components before trial erection. – Alternative inspector to be utilised? Reports were generally good quality but does she have the authority to stop fabrication works if deemed poor? Brickwork jointing to splay corners is a prime example. Trial Erection SM / ENG / Designers to attend full trial erection procedure not just the finished article to see how it actual fits together. Experience for those installing on shift – especially for Con arch design."
Basic design could have been changed to meet new NWR standards. OPUS. Late changes to Pile design due to requirement for CAT 3 checks. Complete demolition and rebuild from ground up would have been easier. Requirement to maintain the existing piers and subsequent piling etc could have been removed from the works. Rushed through to meet deadlines of pre-planned possessions. Poor detailing of Copers – Several missing from original AFC submission and then the basic design was wrong resulting in delays / costs. Suggest CRE / CEM takes a better look at the submission (Use a design Co-ordinator / Graduate Engineers?) Design of brickwork splay corners required cut and bonded special bricks due to dimensions – need to highlight this earlier so we can arrange for cut and bonding works to be carried out to a better standard. Late submission of pile design check required additional pile to be installed to front row – additional time in possession was required to install.
We should be aiming to get TW designs accepted a lot earlier than a Friday PM. Liaise with PM/SM for actual construction programme requirements earlier than present to develop design briefs as soon as possible. More time to be spent upfront on practicable solutions to the TW requirements in line with construction methodology and programme. RMF late with submission of design for temporary works to mass fill shuttering. Option provided was suitable however delay in provision / acceptance could have delayed the contract if crane wasn’t winded off. Sub-contractors do not always provide the correct depth of detail required for temporary works submissions. Must ensure they are fully conversant with requirements when tendering – Early design briefs will help in this situation. Ainscough delay in issue docs resulting in delayed TW submission for slope stability:- Lost possession. Ongoing issue with late submission of documentation from Ainscough on more than one occasion on multiple sites. Sheet piles difficult to install in ground conditions. Alternative solution to be developed where practicable for driving sheet piles in to non-granular formation. Ensure operatives are familiar with pile driving operations prior top possession working.
"JMS labour generally good standard – Keeping same team together from previous contract worked well and will look to continue with this on future projects. Training is difficult to obtain even when requested – JMS operatives should all have the basics as standard: Dumper, Rolller, Slinger, Signaller, Banksman, Small tools (Stihl Saw, Brush Cutters, Grinders, Abrasive Wheels training) Lifting supervisor training is required so lift plans can be written by competent person – Currently no one is trained to this level."
"Llynch Plant – very accommodating – good kit. JMS plant – some good, some bad. (London plant good) Morris Leslie – Good Machines but poor back up service. Looking for costs all the time. Keep to same suppliers – known quantity. Emergency Call out numbers are required for all plant suppliers as standard. Should be provided when plant is delivered."
Long Lead in for eng blue bricks. Bricks – These were ordered early. Remaining bricks used by other contracts. Stone Good supply from GRS / Lafarge. Concrete Lafarge / Mini-mix: good service Cemex (RMF supplier) generally good. Materials generally ordered / delivered in good time for works.
Lack of bricklaying subcontractors – possible to speak to a few relating to future works. Get on board early. Reliance on JMS / RMF agency op’s – quality is sometime poor with costs passed back to ourselves for remedial works. Onsite supervisor was not provided by larger sub contracts resulting in delays and substandard works in areas. (RMF). See Subby review forms – generally good performance by all with few comments.
Final account settled promptly Good use of early warning notices to NWR highlighting potential additional costs.
6 QOBS submitted – 1) Poor Quality Sleepers 2) Depth of Core Holes 3) Setting out error to mass fill works 4) Coper Design (1) 5) Coper Quality (2) 6) Retaining Wall design.
Investigate the use of tarmac road / compound where possible during winter months / long duration contracts – check costs against trackmat hire. Easier to maintain to acceptable standard – good impression of site. Paving slabs to provide walking routes within the main compound? Use of geotextile teram underneath trackmats to prevent mud coming through in wet conditions. Segregation of plant / operatives walkway – new barriers for “PPE” zone to be deployed on next site as standard. Welfare Facilities. Good standard of Welfare maintained – Investigate the supply & use of Lockers for PPE / Clothes – still items of PPE going missing after shifts. Shower units to be on each site? Traffic Management. Good site entrance visibility.
"No incidents to report. Look to enhance sustainability development on future contracts – wheelie bins for separate recycling items (plastics, Paper) , skips to be standardised to three sorts – Canteen general waste, Timber, Metal."
"Delay in issue of F003 / AFC drawings. Designers to issue drawings on time. Work back from critical timelines to give designers deadlines for submissions. Delay in embankment design. The project was started prior to having a finalised design for the approaches. The initial design was to sheet pile through the embankment this was received 6 weeks after we were programmed to start sheet piling. Following receipt of the sheet piling design due to the significant costs to carry out the sheet piling and the amount of temporary works that was going to be required, the approaches were redesigned for the embankments to be re-graded. This meant the need NWR to purchase additional land and standing time was incurred on site due to this issue. Delay with crane works – Ainscough Not been impressed with the service provided by Ainscough for upfront or during the works on site. The upfront service and checking of our temp works by George was poor leading to issues on site rigging the crane, drawings and lift plans were all submitted last minute. Staffing levels for the works were poor. The first crane lifting weekend the slingers / signallers that arrived for the shift did not have PTS and could not work. The relief that was due to take over slinging / signalling on the 2nd weekend did not turn up forcing JMS to cover the works again. Quality of PCC units More time required for manufacture of units – last minute rush will always result in poor quality. Need to confirm how much time fabrication requires and allow for it. Also applies for delivery to site to ensure we have units for lifting / checking. Shay Murthagh Coping are of poor quality and late deliveries during possession added unneeded risk and pressure to site team."
"Site / Office set-up (including security) Commissioning Testing. Surveying Setting out. Construction method. Inspections. Trial Erection. Prior to the start of the project and the site set up, the site team attended a meeting with JMS Culture Development Programme coach in order to encourage the safety execution of the works even before day one. By far, the most important outcome of this meeting was the sketch of the site compound lay-out. This sketch was made after careful consideration of the lessons learned from various projects across all Murphy sectors. Our previous experience has shown the importance of a safe and reliable traffic system on site. Hence a one-way system with 5 mph speed limit was implemented. In addition to it, an unloading area was demarcated, a lay-by for delivery vehicles was set up to park in and report to the site office and the welfare facilities were arranged in a courtyard-like way, with their backs turned to the one-way track keeping site staff from possible collision with oncoming vehicles. The compound configuration described above received full approval and JMS are now standardising the site set up to use on all rail projects wherever it is possible. We provided site entrance gates to distinguish between welfare and site working area. Hence, clarifying where exactly full PPE had to be worn. We also used vehicle/pedestrian segregation barriers to mark and define all footpaths and walking routes. This considerably reduces the risk of people taking unsafe walking routes, especially for visitors unfamiliar with the site layout. The combination of all these small adjustments resulted in a site arrangement which is a wonderful example of the health and safety culture we have adopted. This did not go unnoticed and the client highly praised the site configuration, every time they visited. Lack of designated Site Engineer – split between three sites is not good enough. Enzo was not up to the job and had to be closely monitored. Some simple setting out works were taken away from him and given to the site joiner to set out as he kept making basic mistakes. JMS need their own site engineer that take ownership of the setting out and help with the quality checking process. Most agency engineers are just EDM jockeys and lack understanding of construction methods, sequences and tolerances. During the GRIP 3 process there was a major alteration to the design - the Con arch construction was replaced with a Filler beam deck. The advantages of this solution were less crane lifts required and less construction time spent on site. Changing to filler beam construction also leads to better construction safety as the number of hazards and things that can go wrong are reduced. Fabrication inspections by Vicky Bailey. SM should attend at least once during fabrication to discuss any issues and look at the bridge components before trial erection. A lot of patch repairs carried out. Reports were generally good quality but does she have the authority to stop fabrication works if deemed poor? SM / ENG / Designers to attend full trial erection procedure not just the finished article to see how it actual fits together. Experience for those installing on shift.Shay Murthagh’s did not carry out a trial erection for Harrowden and got me all the way to Ireland to see the units sat in a factory. When pricing PCC fabrication the trial erection should be a separate item as we received no refund even though it wasn’t carried out. On site we had an issue with the deck levels that Amey had got wrong resulting in a 18mm grout shelf having to be constructed under span 2 bearings, if the trial erection had been carried out this would have been picked up."
"Amey .Poor detailing in general. Setting out information missing from designs. Unrealistic sheet piling design forwarded late. No understanding of buildability and commercial consequence of design. Wrong information detailed on design relating to approach containment barrier, not picked up until CAT3 Road Safety Audit carried out. This resulted in having to replace the N2 containment barrier. Suggest CRE / CEM takes a better look at the submission (Use a design Co-ordinator?)."
"We should be aimimg to get TW designs accepted a lot earlier than a Friday PM. Liaise with PM/SM for actual construction programme requirements earlier than present to develop design briefs as soon as possible. More time to be spent upfront on practicable solutions to the TW requirements in line with construction methodology and programme. Ainscough delay in issue docs. Ongoing issue with late submission of documentation from Ainscough on more than one occasion on multiple sites. The upfront service and checking of our temp works for crane access by George was poor leading to issues on site rigging the crane, drawings and lift plans were all submitted last minute."
"JMS labour to a very good standard – Keeping same team together from previous contract worked well and will look to continue with this on future projects. Training is difficult to obtain even when requested – JMS operatives should all have the basics as standard: Dumper, Rolller, Slinger, Signaller, Banksman, Small tools (Stihl Saw, Brush Cutters, Grinders, Abrasive Wheels training) Lifting op training is required so lift plans can be written by competent person – Currently no one is trained to this level."
"Llynch Plant – very accommodating – good kit. JMS plant – some good, some bad. (London plant good) One Call– Good Machines but poor back up service. Keep to same suppliers – known quantity. Emergency Call out numbers are required for all plant suppliers as standard. Should be provided when plant is delivered."
Long Lead in for eng blue bricks. Bricks – These were ordered early. Stone. Good supply from GRS / Lafarge. Concrete Lafarge / Mini-mix: good service Materials generally ordered / delivered in good time for works. e.g. Purchasing Lead times Management / supervision of (including communication) Competence & Experience Lack of bricklaying subcontractors – possible to speak to a few relating to future works. Get on board early. Reliance on JMS / RMF agency op’s – quality is sometime poor with costs passed back to ourselves for remedial works. See Subby review forms – generally good performance by all with few comments.

"No incidents to report. Look to enhance sustainability development on future contracts – wheelie bins for separate recycling items (plastics, Paper) , skips to be standardised to three sorts – Canteen general waste, Timber, Metal."
"Delay in issue of F003 / AFC drawings. Designers were told by JMS to stop work on AFCs to concentrate on Robinsons Bridge which was deemed more urgent. Work back from critical timelines to give designers deadlines for submissions. Weather delays in winter – crane winded off. More allowance for inclement weather should have been built into the construction and Cl14 programmes. Concrete spill onto track – use of permanent works as temporary works. Use of precast riser unit as a shutter to retain deck end concrete led to concrete spilling on to down Fast line. Apart from the cost of taking an emergency line block this led to a week long delay as we were then forced to concrete the deck in a possession. In future the precast must be propped as a matter of course and the designer must be consulted more rigorously than was the case this time. Other NR contractors. Repairs by CML to retaining wall adjoining bridge were started but not finished, leading to delays in reinstating the corner of the bridge. In hindsight we should not have co-operated with NR’s request to let CML start their work, and insisted that they do their work on completion of ours. Ramp reinstatement. Design work was carried out informally which when it became long winded, made it impossible to approach NR for any extension of time. In future the preliminary designs must be formally submitted."
"Good Site establishment for long term set-up – maintain and improve using best practice ideas on next site. Security – Issues with quality of service, different guards all the time, poor timekeeping and lack of patrols from some. Unable to monitor that patrols were actually being carried out. Surveying Setting out. Employment of Land Surveyor as Site Engineer was a mistake, as he had very little understanding of how things are built and the best way of setting them out. As a typical example, lack of basic control led to the cill beams being landed insufficiently far apart to fit the conarches in. Concentrating on millimetre accuracy instead of knowing when fit for purpose is sufficient led to frustrating waste of time in possessions. Lack of foresight in measuring precast units before trying to get them in place likewise led to delays in possessions. Construction method. General build methodology was good. Use of LG1550 strut jib crane as the planned telescopic one was unavailable was a bonus as it could reach all units from one location. The LG1550 is an expensive machine to use, but could limit the number of lifts required to the point where it easily pays for itself. See above remarks about use of permanent works as temporary works. Inspections SM should attend at least once during fabrication to discuss any issues and look at the bridge components before trial erection. As far as I know, no in-process inspections were carried out at all. Trial Erection SM / ENG / Designers to attend full trial erection procedure not just the finished article to see how it actual fits together. Experience for those installing on shift – especially for Con arch design."
"wall that can be seen from outer space when merely replacing the arisings from the excavation would have sufficed. The early design was not submitted formally, so that the time taken in finalising the design could not be recovered contractually. The cost of the design and the works was such that I would not recommend Amey as designers in future."
"Hyders Frustrating from start to finish. The designers had never been to site and relied on topo surveys to produce the design. The design was late because Hyders hugely underestimated the amount of time it would take them to design such a large skewed structure. Finding themselves under resourced they had to ask which of Radwell and Robinsons bridges were more important – in the event it was Robinsons. This led to a six week delay in issuing the F003 and AFCs. Issue of documents was haphazard and admin had a job to keep track of it. Drawing issue register very hard to understand due to it’s format When F003s were finally issued the parapets had to be extended as they did not protect the drop to the top of the cutting. This extension was insufficient, and palisade fences are now to be installed for additional security. The design concentrated only on the bridge. There was no thought given to crash barriers, road reconstruction, landscaping, white lining and the like. Reinforcement detailing made a mockery of our CDM requirement to reduce manual handling, and in some instances the bars were physically impossible to install as detailed. The traditional cutting and splicing was time consuming and led to congestion of bars. Skewed substructure elements should have been detailed with truncated corners to avoid manufacture and installation limitations creating unsightly joints of varying widths. JMS. Should have challenged the options report and gone for a filler beam design. The high skew and long spans made a conarch design difficult to make, transport and install. Conarches are inappropriate for twin span structures due to the void created in the pier being a serious work at height hazard. Amey/JMS. Amey were requested to produce a design for reinstating the access ramp. The result is a gabion We should be aiming to get TW designs accepted a lot earlier than a Friday PM. Liaise with PM/SM for actual construction programme requirements earlier than present to develop design briefs as soon as possible. More time to be spent upfront on practicable solutions to the TW requirements in line with construction methodology and programme. RMF late with submission of design for temporary works to mass fill shuttering. Option provided was suitable however delay in provision / acceptance could have delayed the contract had other events not already done so. Sub-contractors do not always provide the correct depth of detail required for temporary works submissions. Must ensure they are fully conversant with requirements when tendering – Early design briefs will help in this situation. Radius Crane Management Use of lifting specialists to plan and carry out contract lifts instead of relying on Ainscough worked well. The paperwork was to a far higher standard and the equipment brought to site was more usable – air hoists instead of chain blocks, web slings instead of chains. Detailed crane planning took far less of SM’s time. Crane pad design Window sampling a waste of time money and effort. It led to a design which was so conservative that we ended up digging out solid rock and replacing it with a 1m depth of imported hardcore."
"JMS labour generally good standard – Two bricklayers recruited at the start of the contract have turned out to be very skilful stone masons who can turn their hand to most trades and will undertake more or less anything. Training is difficult to obtain even when requested – JMS operatives should all have the basics as standard: Dumper, Roller, Slinger, Signaller, Banksman, Small tools (Stihl Saw, Brush Cutters, Grinders, Abrasive Wheels training) Lifting op training is required so lift plans can be written by competent person – Currently no one is trained to this level."
"Llynch Plant – very accommodating – good kit. JMS plant – some good, some bad. Keep to same suppliers – known quantity. Emergency Call out numbers are required for all plant suppliers as standard. Should be provided when plant is delivered. One Call CW plant Speedy Hire Good service Good service Not always so speedy, and different depots might as well be different companies. Use of central ordering point does not work and P & T end up speaking to various depots as it is quicker and easier."
"Long Lead in for eng blue bricks .Bricks – These were ordered early and picked up by Shay Murtagh for incorporation in precasting. Stone. Good supply from GRS / Lafarge. Keyline .General materials supplier, moving away from the Kingswinford depot as the first point of contact may prove to be a mistake, as the contact there (Elwyn Jones) is remarkably helpful, knowledgeable and resourceful. Concrete. Volumetric supply in possessions: good service Cemex (RMF supplier) generally good. Hope CM supply good until we got put on stop. Materials generally ordered / delivered in good time for works. Ordering via Golborne Big mistake. If you need materials in a hurry due to a change in design, unforeseeable circumstances, last minute requests from NR etc you are in trouble. They will not issue an order number to allow collection locally and take as much time as they would in ordering materials generally."
 Lack of bricklaying subcontractors – we were lucky when Pat Smith recruited two and put them on the books Onsite supervisor was not provided by larger sub contracts resulting in delays and substandard works in areas. (RMF). See Subby review forms – generally good performance by all with few comments.
.Price was submitted on F001 design at NRs request. Options report should have been challenged. NR never issue PMIs. Progress meetings in house with no NR representation.
6 NCRs submitted – 1) Poor setting out 2) Overbreak in demolition 3) Reinforcement detailing 4) Reinforcement detailing 5) 6G material condemned 6) Parapet design.
Site Set-up .Consider use of concrete or paving slabs as walkways to keep accommodation clean. Investigate the use of tarmac road / compound where possible during winter months / long duration contracts – check costs against trackmat hire. Easier to maintain to acceptable standard – good impression of site. Use of geotextile terram underneath trackmats to prevent mud coming through in wet conditions. Segregation of plant / operatives walkway – new barriers for “PPE” zone were deployed and work well. Welfare Facilities. Good standard of Welfare maintained – Investigate the supply & use of Lockers for PPE / Clothes – still items of PPE going missing after shifts. Shower was provided but never used. Site safety Periodic inspections show that safety standards were generally good and the men wear their PPE as they should. Traffic Management Good site entrance visibility.
"Look to enhance sustainability development on future contracts – wheelie bins for separate recycling items (plastics, paper). Skips were standardised to three sorts – Canteen general waste, Timber, Metal Re-use of compound material on nearby NR contracts has reduced waste report figures greatly. Waste reporting Has been made difficult with introduction of electronic WTNs Countrywide WM – do they provide the information from skip changes that they should – I do not believe they do. EMR – do they actually credit us with scrap metal revenue or just keep it for themselves. Brick parapets. It cannot be environmentally sustainable to transport bricks to Ireland by road and ferry and then transport them back again as part of the precast units. Alternative designs and increased site brickwork should be looked at where practicable."
"Weighing in scrap .Once a nice bonus for the site team, it’s being outlawed has removed a good way of keeping site morale high."
"Delay in issue of F003 / AFC drawings. Client to allow sufficient time to design and issue Construction Drawings in advance of works commencing on site. Work back from critical timelines to give designers deadlines for submissions. Delay in land purchase creating construction sequencing issues. Tardy response by NR Land Purchase Team delayed embankment re-grade works and necessitated Construction activities re-sequencing and inefficient works. Design required regrade of the existing embankments to 3 corners of the structure, necessitating land purchase. The purchase was tardy and works started on site without the full contract being in place. Client to ensure land purchase timelines are in accordance with Construction program. Delay in embankment design creating poor final product. The project was started prior to having a finalised design for the SW approach. The Maccaferri wall design was received after the main demolition works activity and disrupted the construction sequencing. Following receipt of the wall design, discussions continued with the private landowner late into the project with works starting on site 4 weeks before road open dates. The wall works were rushed and poor quality has resulted in additional works being required some moths later."
"Elongated set up was not in accordance with the JMS Best Practice. One way traffic route was not adequately used by site team. All future set ups to follow Best Practice. Surveying Setting out. Lack of JMS Site Engineer – use of Agency Engineers is not good enough – setting out and quality control standards are severely jeopardised. Kerb lines were set out 3 or 4 times and still proven to be incorrect leading to additional remedial works required to the full road alignment some moths after works have been completed.. JMS own Site Engineer that take ownership of the setting out and the quality checking process and using their understanding of construction methods, sequences and tolerances. Construction Methodology. Delays with the land purchase and approach designs/construction works commencement created constructability and efficient methodology issues due to re-sequencing. Constructing the approach earthworks and retaining solutions must happen as early as possible in the program to enure efficiency and reduce the number of hazards and things that can go wrong accordingly. Inspections & Records Quality Control and inspections of critical works was poor by the site team. Failure to record progress by photos and reports. Increased visits by JMS Quality Manager, Senior Managers and CRE to ensure that works are constructed according to design. Trial Erection. SM / ENG / Designers to attend full trial erection procedure not just the finished article to see how it actual fits together. Experience for those installing on shift – especially Con Arch designs."
"Poor detailing for highways associated works. Setting out dimensions missing from designs. Inconsistent design of approach containment barrier fixing, barrier designs, perimeter fencing, kerbing details lead to unfamiliarity for site teams and consequential construction difficulties. Lack of clarity of some detailing - the approach corners were cast, cut, re-cast several times before the final result was achieved – this still requires further remedial works to achieve the necessary quality standards Suggest CRE / CEM takes a better look at the submission."
"Temporary Works designs to be submitted to suit program dates - more time to be spent upfront on practicable solutions to the TW requirements in line with construction methodology and programme. Ainscough delays. Ongoing issue with late submission of documentation from Ainscough on more than one occasion on multiple sites. The upfront service and checking of our temp works for crane access was poor leading to issues on site rigging the crane, drawings and lift plans were all submitted last minute. Lack of ownership by Ainscough in getting the work done in the timeframes allowed – 7 hours waiting for 1 crane lift of the SW parapet due to shift change and lack of interest by crane crews."
"JMS labour to a very good standard – Keeping same team together from previous contract worked well and will look to continue with this on future projects. JMS Site Engineers required to ensure setting out and quality function are completed to JMS standards. Training is improving albeit slowly – JMS operatives should all have the basics as standard: Dumper, Roller, Slinger, Signaller, Banksman, Small tools (Stihl Saw, Brush Cutters, Grinders, Abrasive Wheels training) Lifting op training is required so lift plans can be written by competent person – Currently no one is trained to this level."
Keep to same suppliers – known quantity. Emergency Call out numbers are required for all plant suppliers as standard. Should be provided when plant is delivered.
Long lead in for Engineering .Class 2 Solid bricks Ordered early. Stone Good supply. Concrete Good service. General .Materials generally ordered / delivered in good time for works.
"Purchasing Lead times Management / supervision of (including communication) Competence & Experience Lack of bricklaying subcontractors – reliance on JMS / RMF agency op’s – quality is poor with costs passed back to ourselves for remedial works. RMF sub contract skilled labour is generally inexperienced and lacking competence. Scaffolder generally good, but need to ensure that lodging locally during continued periods on site to ensure full shifts utilised."

General .Poor quality control in general – final outcome is substandard and extensive remedial works is required post completion. Hold Points .Hold points to be added to the program to ensure quality control points are checked by Senior Management before proceeding to the next construction stage.
"Site team failed to record progress fully (photos and reports). Need to ensure full stages of construction are inspected and recorded, whilst raising Quality Observations and TQs accordingly."
"Hard access/ standing road / compound to be used during winter months / long duration contracts. Easier to maintain to acceptable standard – good impression of site. Paving slabs to provide walking routes within the main compound, geofab under buildings for weed control (no stone required) Use of geotextile teram underneath trackmats to prevent mud coming through in wet conditions.

Shower units to be on each site – Best Practice. Traffic Management Good site entrance visibility. Pedestrian/site vehicle interaction – poor control of gate by site team. Goal Posts – poor control – establish from onset of works till demob."
"Incidents Waste Management Overhead cable strike incidents during demob due to poor management and lack of controls – goal posts. Waste Management – 3 skips operated well – Canteen general waste, Timber, Metal. Recycling A structured system of stone/brick/concrete recycling required for future works."
Production of Management of programme .Detailed Programming with sequence drawings are important on schemes where clear access may not be available. Site Manger being involved with IDC Discussions and feedback with CRE. Try and ensure that the Programme allows for value engineering and clearly highlights the sequence of procurement and critical activities. Meetings on site .Progress meetings with subcontractors should be regularly held with minutes produced. Site manager let site and programme slip and took a negative attitude towards the client and or putting the contract right. Relieved the contingency Site Manager from his position.
"Hoarding along temp scaffold walkways as a buffalo board. Prevents people jumping or climbing over but it also prevents pedestrians stopping to take a look, restricting thoroughfare as you have concealed the works from them. Pre Cast Concrete Inspection Shay Murtagh .The bridge deck inspection was carried out although issues arose with the installation sequence. What was noticeable is the poor quality of the precast concrete deck planks - visible differences in the widths of the planks and Straight edges. Pre Cast Inspection Shay Murtagh. Although the deck was inspected when all pieced together it did not include the steel that had to be placed through the skewed bridge. The pockets in the deck planks did not align correctly. In future the use of a laser pen could be used to highlight if the steel reinforcement bar can pass freely through from one side to the other, including room for another bar to splice."
Lack of Service Drawings provided by the client with the potential to impede works. Liaise and request earlier on future contracts. Over Engineered Re –Bar Design .Similar bridge used all straight lasers with a few different bar marks. This was faster and more cost efficient due to less bar bending. Working from F002/3. AFC drawings should be in place for the start of the works on site. Bad Design Build-ability. Bridge parapet approach units overhang and centre of gravity was unstable to say the least. The buildability should have been considered in greater detail as 25mm difference in measurement would have toppled the unit.
"The temporary scaffold pedestrian bridge is arranged so that the pedestrians and services were diverted out of the way. Unfortunately no one had thought ahead on how the approach units can be landed as they conflict with the temporary service diversion and pedestrian footbridge. When dismantling the existing bridge span and removing the deck it became apparent that the corners of the abutment wall had collapsed and under greater inspection, once the deck had been removed, the mortar in the brick joints had failed. This resulted in having to reduce the brickwork until the mortar was fine and then rebuilding the corners of the abutments. Thus costing money and time for possessions, labour, materials and time. More stringent surveys required of the abutment brickwork prior to bridge removals."
"Labour Planning JMS have provided internal labour and safety critical staff. The site manager had to relieve men from site to keep up with mandatory training. The manger had to be relieved from his position due to lack of drive and commitment to complete the works in a safe, timely and professional manner. Labour RMF have provided adequate labour. ."
Service Diversion Greater liaison required with third parties for utilities to be moved back through the bridge and lead times.
Previous Management Unfortunately the contingency site manager whom was running this scheme appears not to have been pro-active in management of the project. Fortunately we now have a JMS manager whom has taken over and with his experience and enthusiasm he should move the contract along swiftly.
"Welfare Facilities .Although the welfare area was a nearby hired industrial unit, the kitchen space and drying room facilities on a JMS general container are far better. Traffic Management .Traffic Management services were provided by an external contractor whom specialises in that field. No issues with their attendance or performance."
 Previous Site Manager. The previous site manger was not familiar and stated that he was not completing the smart waste system due to lack of training. Spoil Away Waste spoils have been mass collected in grab lorries from site thus mitigating on skips by Lynch Plant.
" No lifting eyes on Coper. These should be included in the design to help with build ability and speed up the laying process. The steel design was efficiently designed, i.e. uniform bar sizes/spacing’s etc. This should be requested to the designer whenever feasible as this can be a time consuming task."
" Lack of design detail up front has meant that the team has spent time in diamond drilling through reinforced concrete. Designer to liaise with JMS to think about the buildability of the element which could save time. Drawings were not sent as AFC to site. It is fundamental that the CEM sign off designs as AFC to site - the Site Manager should not proceed with the works otherwise. Network Rail have not been forthcoming with service drawings. JMS need to acquire these as early as possible because they will have an influence on many aspects of design, including temporary works. This is a problem that has been noticed on several sites."
 Good workforce But everyman must take responsibility for a messy site. Give Credit were due.
"These were of good quality and no remedial work was required post-delivery. ITP’s should be thoroughly followed and any non[1]conform elements rejected. If the sub-contractor provides good quality material, they should be favoured going forward."
 Radius Crane. Management have proved very efficient and good with their cranes This is a sentiment felt across several projects and they should be consulted further going forward.
 Lack of communication between Network Rail and the local council The scope of the works should be clearly set out prior to the start of works and any changes should take into account the effects on the programme.
"Material was recycled on site This was a result of liaising with Network Rail, which allowed waste material to be used as embankment fill."
"Programme developed in isolation from the delivery team. Programme should be treated as a major project. Programme showed the possessions for each site but did not include the TM access. Show a TM access bar on the programme to make it clear when we have access. Access booked within correct timescales, but due to design and production delays, these were missed and access deadlines were overrun Include a hole point in the programme to show when additional access is required to be booked/cancelled."
"Desktop survey undertaken and no detailed site visit. Ensure that a full topo survey is undertaken on all sites to ensure the designs are correct. FJD did not price for undertaking a full topo survey. Ensure designers have priced to undertake a full topo survey. MS are to check designer’s drawings before approval as part of the review process. Ensure that a JMS engineer checks all drawings with physical site measurements. Little or no engineering support at the beginning of the contract. Ensure engineering support is available throughout the contract, from design through to construction. Construction method is not uniform across each type of bridge. Some concrete copers have dowels designed in before installation, others have the dowels dropped down through the copers into the bridge. Ensure a uniform method of construction across similar bridge types. Designs were difficult to construct on site. Installation method was to pre drill the core holes, and then place the coper on top of the dowels. Prepare method for installation devised during the design phase. Lifting eyes have not been cast into the top of the copers. Ensure lifting eyes are cast into the top surface of the copers. Limited options undertaken at commencement of the contract. WOE parapet schemes have been done with installing steel mesh on top of concrete copers. Offering a number of options to the client, as has been done by AMCO to reduce on site durations and cost. Damage has been caused to the copers / bridges resulting from having to commence drilling on an angled surface. Ensure that all teams are briefed exactly with the methodology and ensure that the onsite supervision adheres to this. Methodology has not been followed by the drilling teams.I.T.P and quality plan not in place prior to commencement of works. Ensure robust ITP is in place before commencement of works on site."
"Designs delivered late due to overloading designer with the quantity of designs that were need on the same date. Split the designs into smaller batches to allow delivery, or confirm the designer is able to meet the deadlines. No regular design meetings with JMS and FJD. Ensure fortnightly design meetings are arranged and attended. Insufficient time for the CRE to review the designs to the detail required. Ensure enough CRE provision is provided to allow designs to be reviewed within the timescales allowed. No drawing register in place due to unclear ownership of the drawing register and who should be updating it. A clear understanding on who has ownership of the drawing register. Suggested that this is maintained by JMS document control and C.E.M. Failed to engage and have input to the design at an early stage as once engaged no engineering support was given to manage the designs and ensure that they were as desired. Allocate an engineering resource to manage the design process and meet with the designer on a regular basis."
Supervisors were not familiar with the works to be completed as supervisors were pulled from other sites to cover a shift as a tick box exercise. As a result the correct methods were not followed. Ensure a core team is in place and ownership of the sites is in place. nexperienced staff in place to manage complex works. Ensure senior/experienced staff are available to support /guide and assist when needed to prevent mistakes.Mixed standard of quality of labour. JMS management team to monitor the standard of labour and train/remove them.
All plant arrived and left site as requested. Continue with good work.
"ABM had assured delivery dates but missed these. Due to the delays, it caused the possessions to be missed and delay to the project. Ensure that the delivery schedule is adhered to. No robust incoming and acceptance process. Ensure the robust inspection process is in place. Wastage due to poor design and manufacture. Ensure a robust inspection process is in place."
"RMF de-scoped certain items of the works which caused additional costs to JMS. Subcontract package to be as a complete package of work (TM, access equipment etc...) Only one company was PTI’d for the works from the tender returns. Ensure that all successful ITT returns are PTI’d. McNealey Brown were very good in arriving on site when needed. Continue use. Greeves Transport very good in arriving on site when needed. Continue use. Amberon not brining correct equipment to site at all times. This has cost us a number of possessions and delayed the project. They were replaced with Traffix. Programme was accelerated as a result of design delays. Ensure shifts are planned further in advance to allow time to get the correct staff on site as opposed to a free person."
"Failed to allow enough time for: design review, EH review, LA reviews and construction. Ensure that robust durations are allowed for. Not enough engineering resource / cost and topo surveys. Ensure allowed for. Inadequate plant allowance. Ensure construction method and plant needed is fully allowed for. Working without PMI’s confirmed in some cases. Ensure a costed PMI is in place. Not a full understanding of how the EB / Project wise process was to be used. Ensure that the process is communicated clearly to all parties and adequate staff are in place to deal with the volume of works."
Verbal communication not supporting in writing as a result of this the designer has gone back on what was confirmed over the phone and has caused a delay to the project. Ensure that verbal communications are confirmed in writing.
" For positive issues this may be the action you took to ensure the outcome was successful For negative issues this may include what you would do differently, the action you took to correct the problem and/or the action to prevent re[1]occurrence. Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. Please use a new row for each point. Please do not use numbers/numerals. Outage programme not confirmed .Scheduling & Resourcing difficult to organise due to uncertainty of site programme. Programme should be agreed and achievable before we mobilise and all correct paper work/ Drawings in place. The requisition process for ordering both materials and plant needs streamlining to avoid delays. To order a piece of plant or any materials, first a req must be produced so that items can be sourced and priced, then it requires a sequential number via the document controller, then budgeting and then signing off by commercial and management at site level before any action is taken to procure/provide the items.

It has been noticed that occasionally plant is sat idle with the engine running for extended periods of time, using diesel, when e.g. the generator should have been turned off or the excavator turned off.

An informal Tool Box Talk was carried out to raise the op’s environmental awareness so that these incidents do not re-occur. Jet wash water bowsers are “banned” items on EAN sites We had hired a jet wash to predominantly clean items that had been used for concreting such as the easy float and concrete skip/chute.

This was rejected and we were instructed to remove it from site quite strongly by NG and we complied with this instruction. The internal/external plant sheets, hire and off hire requisition sheets, defect forms etc are not the same format or in the same order from week to week. This makes the whole plant process a time consuming operation which could be streamlined saving all sites and P&T valuable time. If all the sheets were in the same format and sequenced the same way, and the sheets were in the same order from week to week, it would be far easier for sites to hire/off hire and control the plant and equipment.

"A pneumatic air gun driven by a compressor has been utilised to shear off the security nuts on the perimeter fence. There are approximately 120 fence panels, with 17 pales each, 2 nuts on each, totalling approximately 4000 nuts. Using the gun has been efficient, it also reduces the risk to the operatives from repetitive strain. CAT & Genny provided to site. The original CAT & genny’s provided to site were not held in the highest regard by the trained and competent HSG47 op’s. They were consulted regarding what would be preferred and what could be sourced. The originals were off hired and the chosen ones hired in. Confidence in feedback from the machines and safer digging practices followed with this swap. Plant being left idling or used for transport around site. It has been noticed that occasionally plant is sat idle with the engine running for extended periods of time, using diesel, when e.g. the generator should have been turned off or the excavator turned off. It has also been noticed that mobile plant has been used to relay messages when a phone call from a place of safety or an operatives legs could have been used instead. An informal Tool Box Talk was carried out to raise the op’s environmental awareness so that these incidents do not re-occur. Jet wash water bowsers are “banned” items on EAN sites We had hired a jet wash to predominantly clean items that had been used for concreting such as the easy float and concrete skip/chute. It was also used to clean vehicles from time to time without using any detergent. We were notified that using a jet wash to clean vehicles was prohibited and asked to remove it from site. An argument was put forth stating that it would be positioned by the concrete wash out skip and only used for this purpose and not for cleaning vehicles. This was rejected and we were instructed to remove it from site quite strongly by NG and we complied with this instruction. The internal/external plant sheets, hire and off hire requisition sheets, defect forms etc are not the same format or in the same order from week to week. This makes the whole plant process a time consuming operation which could be streamlined saving all sites and P&T valuable time. If all the sheets were in the same format and sequenced the same way, and the sheets were in the same order from week to week, it would be far easier for sites to hire/off hire and control the plant and equipment. We are sure this would make it more efficient for P&T also. The sheets used are in both word and excelFor example, each item could be given a sequential number from the start of the job so it would be easier to track and display the items. Point of work, task specific safety alerts to be displayed. Areas that require task specific PPE or activities that have recent, relevant safety alerts should have signs & alerts displayed at the point of work where the activity is occurring. E.g. where the bench saw/chop saw is being used, signage indicating ear protection & full face visor should be displayed along with any recent abrasive wheel S.A."
"Use of Frami metal shutters Reduce use of timber, more efficient to erect, better finished product. The site team inherited the welfare facilities provided from when the site was moth balled.

Although many of the operatives are travelling from different parts of the country, once they reach site, as many vehicles as possible are parked and left on site overnight. Through the week to travel to and from the digs the minibus is utilised. This saves fuel, reduces wear and tear on the vehicles and does not reduce the service intervals.

Project Site League Tables. Produced once a month and detail various items. This allows site to focus on highlighted areas such as observation cards and best practices. Elstree produces its own observation card count so the site team can monitor numbers allowing a focus on areas of improvement such as reporting.
"Outage programme not confirmed .Scheduling & Resourcing difficult to organise due to uncertainty of site programme. Programme should be agreed and achievable before we mobilise and all correct paper work/ Drawings in place The requisition process for ordering both materials and plant needs streamlining to avoid delays. To order a piece of plant or any materials, first a req must be produced so that items can be sourced and priced, then it requires a sequential number via the document controller, then budgeting and then signing off by commercial and management at site level before any action is taken to procure/provide the items. This process can fall down at any one of the above steps. We feel this process needs refining to improve efficiency and avoid delays."
Several control stations not marked correctly on site or on drawing. Confusion about control stations. Could lead to setting out errors. A hand over from engineer to engineer should have taken place. Due to lack of resources this did not happen.
"National Grid have changed the installation designs three times now which has put a strain on the design of this along with programme/resourcing , All avenues should be discussed and reviewed at an earlier stage to prevent unnecessary work being done. Drawing pack not produced. Only limited numbers of drawings available when work commenced. Small number of assured drawings one month into the job. Potential delays to program, ordering materials and plant. Inefficient work. Early view of design drawings/input from construction team. Positive changes from site team to reduce manual handling issues, efficient and easier construction by changing design. e.g. from concrete draw pits to Rapid stack sections. Delays in producing AFC drawings. Resultant delay in being able to order materials and therefore delays to programme, inefficient working as not able to follow planned activities.

Use of plant nappies opposed to drip trays that collect water and require emptying often resulting in ground contamination. The nappies are also easy to handle and provide more effective spillage control.
"HVSCC programme not Met. The date was not met due to a number of reasons but on the civil side there was an issue with a change of fencing contractor who had to re submit drawings which delayed the energisation of the fence. De Scope of works .The progress on site was difficult to plan and maintain due to a de scope in works, which was not clear as to exactly what was needed to be done. Work was being completed and then redone to do extra works."
Surveying Setting out Construction method Inspections Commissioning Testing. Testing and commissioning .This needs to be done by the M&E side of the JV as civils do not have the expertise. This has led to delays in organising the sub-contractors to site. Engineers There is a need for more than one engineer to be on site to progress works.
"Due to de scope and change of fence contractor, there has been a delay in AFC getting stamped and sent back to site.

"The use of timber, more efficient to erect, better finished product. Use of Joiners shed. Keeping materials dry and allowing a 110v supply for power tools."
"Too much interface on perimeter. fence There where major problems on the perimeter fence with EAN and Freedom. Civils where excavating the posts and erecting, freedom had the contract to rail and pale the fence. This introduced a blame culture."
High rate of SM change over. Incomplete documentation and checks. Drawing not being checked by assurance. Posts delivered to site and a number erected that where not to specification. The drawing showed the post out of spec. Concrete finish. Concrete paths and hard standing up to a high standard of finish but more operatives need to be trained as we do not have enough to keep up the high standard.
The one way system allows safer driving conditions and also introduced more parking bays on site to easy the high volume of cars. First aid and emergency stations. A dedicated operative was assigned to check the emergency boxes and first aid on site weekly. This means check are not missed. Limited number of hooks/pegs in the drying room .A shortage of pegs in the drying room would mean PPE often was not hung up and would not dry overnight. Also the drying room set up is not adequate for the amount of men on site.
Plant Nappies Use of plant nappies opposed to drip trays that collect water and require emptying often resulting in ground contamination. The nappies are also easy to handle and provide more effective spillage control.
"During the core weekend we had the same operative using the RRV & the excavator which wasted valuable time, one of the machine drivers had unfortunately fallen ill shortly before the core shift. Resources were stretched due to the ongoing COVID Pandemic, however for future schemes, further emphasis to be added to resilience planning. Contingency staff to be in place should a similar issue arise."
"Issues arisen during the core weekend with regards to excavation levels and the amount of digging required. This resulted in handing back the possession late. For similar future schemes GI/Core holes to be completed at cill level.On site machinery during the core weekend was incorrect for what was required. We had an 8T machine when in reality it should’ve been a 13T. The machine wasn’t able to complete the required level of digging in the timescales we had due to it being a smaller capacity machine in terms of reach/volume of material it was able to grab in each dig. No curtailable activities contained in core possession programme, need to ensure that more resilience is built into core possession programme."
"Procurement process takes too long. As part of this scheme there was a requirement to replace road signage, the discussions with the council for approval took place too late in the day, this resulted in having to procure/source a subcontractor to undertake the road signage works at last minute."
"Lost time incident occurred at this site, an operative stepped out of a van and injured his ankle due to stepping on a ridge in the Terrafirma matting. On site visual checks for the matting to be completed daily, ridged edges to be sprayed potentially to make staff aware of potential slips/trips. Ongoing internal review over access matting use by Tom Lacy/Daire Murphy."
Heights and Staggers Survey not requested for pre or post works. When working under OLE always complete a H&S survey pre and post works. Planning consent was tight and only approved in time for core possession. Planning consent was tight and only approved in time for core possession.
P-way on a curve made it difficult to align new with old. Pre-Curved rail to be purpose procured for rails with curves within. Plates didn’t fit as designed without alterations. Trial assembly to draw out lessons or alterations required prior to core possession. Failed weld due to proximity to existing weld. Weld locations to be double checked prior to commencement to ensure compliance.
Noise Monitoring permissions were only granted 48 hours before the possession however Covid 19 lockdown and MCC requests did limit this. All mitigations requested by the council were put in place and no complaints were received.
"Time of year the scheme was completed may have increased the chances f poor weather and increased water within the ground on site. Inclement weather experienced in Nov/Dec. Works required the embankment to be worked so vegetation was lost. Re-Authority required prior to starting on site. Increase scope. RF8 estimate not sufficient/acknowledged. Baselined at RF8 was starting point, however additional scope was captured and added to ATC (increase of roughly £700k). Maintenance tamping postponement . Lack of communication between the Pic and NR team. wasn’t highlighted at the Pic (prior to going to site). Land Access . No land access could be secured for headwall works at 66m 1660yds. Low internal NR resource required to outsource surveyor to an also low resourced external surveying company."
Scheme delivered to programme and cost and delivered to the required quality of the client. • Good understanding of the scope of the scheme during planning stage. Robust programme at the outset. All personal involved pulled together and worked as a team. Regular communication/updates from site as well as site visits. JMS site management.
"Failure 1 - At Heyford Hills (66M 1110y to 66m 1122y). Wet weather in the preceding weeks leading to high soil moisture levels and associated porewater pressures. Requirement to trim/rework the cutting slope in order to install the cess drainage through this section of earthwork. It would appear that this has resulted in a slight steepening of the cutting slope at this location. Temporary absence of vegetation on the slope, allowing more rapid infiltration of surface water and softening of the shallow soils. The lack of “binding” vegetation will increase the potential for shallow movement/slumping, opening up small tension cracks which in turn allows surface water to penetrate deeper. Temporary absence of vegetation and cropping in the adjacent field, allowing more rapid flow of surface water towards the cutting. Although the corresponding catchment area is small, the increase in flow rate could have contributed to the instability. In combination with the presence of reworked ground at the crest could potentially have reduced infiltration rates for surface water into the underlying strata, thereby increasing run off. Potentially overly focussed on designing to budget. Wet weather in the preceding weeks leading to high soil moisture levels and associated porewater pressures. The low permeability nature of the clay strata forming the cutting mean that the beneficial effect of the counterfort drains would have not yet taken effect. General ground disturbance associated with the installation of deep counterforts and cess drainage works. The excavation activities will have resulted in a change in soil stresses and soil moisture in the immediate vicinity of the dig, possibly triggering localised movement which then developed over time due to other factors. In general terms, digging into a large, sensitive cutting with marginal FoS will never be without risk, as some movement/disturbance of the surrounding ground will inevitably occur during construction. In this case, the fact that the earthwork has suffered significant movement in the past, resulting in localised planes of weakness may also have been a factor.Look at better connecting the designer into the JMS constructability reviews. This was raised as a potential improvement area on the back of the scheme. Traditionally JMS have done the buildability reviews internally, rather than inviting the designer to these."
Feedback from the RAM team advised that the capturing of the new drainage assets was of low quality. Lack of sufficient training? Lack of support/direction from NR asset management team on what they’re looking for? The Pole Star software used by JMS didn’t provide information required by System Support Manager.
"Roles and responsibilities (and therefore accountability) should be clearly defined at the start of the project and reflected in Organogram - review of requirements at Fit to Start, requirements for training and escalation processes to ensure available required"
Ensure pre-start meetings are started and minuted prior to site works.
"poor communication between management and answering questions. Late input of drawings, changes not adapted in time. Planned and actual were never aligned in method plant and equipment.  Standard of kit supplied and behaviours were not as expected.  Turnover of staff was high and supplied through a labour agency. Only 2 of the Active Tunnelling team knew what they were doing and were good to have on site."

"Historically the NCR tool (Alcumus) has not been used as intended, there is a perception that its a ""Quality"" tool, awareness has been raised on HPC byway of the Quality toolbox talks which highlight quality is everyone's responsibility and that anyone can raise an NCR on the system. There is still work to be done with the team to lose the stigma that the NCR process is a finger pointing exercise rather that a continuous improvement tool."
"The decision whether to use Aconex as the vehicle for document control / transmittal or the use of the ""Mantronic"" F drive folders still sits with the Project manager at the start of projects.  It is worth considering at Project kick-off to move away from the antiquated F Drive and move towards the more controlled automated Aconex system, this system also has the functionality to have electronic workflows for document review's and approval's which would eradicate any potential for documents to circumvent the system or allow documents to be released non-compliantly."

"During the Material & Stores Control audit (HINK - JMS - ZZ - XX- AR-W-0001) dated 20-Aug-20 it was highlighted that the stores had never had a Stocktake carried since the initiation of the Project, further probing found that there isn't currently a requirement or procedure calling for this. As a best practice exercise stocktakes should be carried out periodically to avoid over stocking, and potentially lost stock due to shelf life of consumable products or under stocking resulting in potential time lost waiting for product at site."

"During the installation of a 900m section of 132 KV cable (1200sqmm cable weighing 30kgs per m) through ducting in a downhill direction an uncontrolled movement occurred, resulting in the entire section length of cable exiting the ducting and coiling at JB09 causing damage to equipment and cable. It was highlighted during the wider investigation that two previous incidents of similar nature have occurred on cable projects within the UK (in 2017 and February 2020). Details of these incidents had not been received by Murphy. This has highlighted a failure in the communication of significant lessons learned between contractors, clients and industry bodies on this topic. This is considered to be a contributory factor in this incident."

Gap analysis required to ensure all those now utilised for project type on system to avoid any delays/issues. Risk related to single source e.g. SCADA (see Didcot Aconex field entry 7)
Design process and change control - introduction of design decision log and tying in with communications; lack of feedback from client and team. Needs to be appropriate to the project to reflect the works and what has driven the change and what method to report.

Needs to be detailed/complete to allow use for contract development and not just for client to meet contractual requirement. Requirement at site level for site Planner attendance to review from buildable and believable state based on bottom up review at Contract Award.
IV management - development of procedure detailed enough at site level for operation including design and setting to work and gives clear expectations on roles and responsibilities. Needs to include how RAMS fit in; what drawings are required against what is needed to give to the client to establish the standard baseline requirement; more discussion should be encouraged with site installation personnel to allow elements of flexibility; review how the various pieces of the document are used needs to be determined within the procedure. Review requirement for additional IV awareness training need for NG sites.
"Buildability issues - review at site level for design e.g. trough lids. Design reviewed what would be acceptable to NG however there were more practicable ways for client to achieve but inability to find alternative materials to achieve. Hazard review in conjunction found 2 man heavy lift but then resulted in protruding trip hazard, whereas GRP could not achieve fire rating. ensure interaction from specialisms at early stage to review information for construction buildability e.g. Site Engineer (Snr) during design process prior to submission rather than following design submission and as approved - invitation to Engineering Manager?"

"Defective fillet welds on RMA HKSF-W100 Ball Valves (specification GIS/V6) 
Introduction 
Another UK Gas Network Company has observed, through gas leakage, pin holes off 
drain/vent point fillet welds on multiple new RMA HKSF-W100 ball valves during 
commissioning activity. Other non-through wall weld defects were also observed.  
The valves were supplied to specification GIS/V6.  
The manufacturer, RMA, has conducted an initial root cause assessment and advised end 
users, including Cadent direct and via main works contractors, of valves which may be at risk 
from similar quality issues. 

 

Cause of Failure 
The cause of the defects and how they passed factory quality control are under 
investigation.   
Cadent and other Gas Distribution Network Operators are working with RMA to 
determine root causes and implement production weld procedure, inspection test 
plan and QA/QC improvements. 
The range of RMA valves currently known at risk of similar quality issues are specified as: 
- Model HKSF-W100 
- Sizes DN50 to DN300 
- Class 150, 300 & 600 
At present no indication has been given on timeframe to assess valves at risk, although 
those with defects were manufactured no earlier than January 2019.  

 

Action 
1. Until further notice, do not procure RMA valves which fall within model and 
specification criteria stated above. 

 

2. Do not install or commission any new RMA valves which fall within model and 
specification criteria stated above. Quarantine these valves and Inform the 
QA/QC team on: box.supplychainquality@cadentgas.com of item location, 
status, serial number and specification details and a copy of the full valve 
inspection & test plan (ITP) pack from supplier or distributer. The valve will be 
assessed by RMA to determine if at risk of similar defect, and further advice 
given on action to be taken on case by case basis.  

 

3. Report any suspect valves or defects immediately to the QA/QC team."

"During testing it was observed that one of the terminals in the joint box of turret 1a1 (SGT2) appeared to be loose, when the engineer tried to re-tighten the pin just spun, indicating the base of the threaded pin was stripped.

The transformers and their ancillaries are free issue items from NG to JMS, the fault came out of the ABB's manufacturing facility in this condition.

NG was made aware to enable them to capture this issue on their system."

"Following on a discussion with National Grid Quality Advisor on site, Site Drawing Index discrepancies were identified between the existing SDI structure on site and the one provided on ECM LiveLink by NG. Corrective Actions required will include: Design coordinator to raise a TQ to clarify which SDI structure will be used, propose and agree amendments to the filing system, and retrospectively update the CDL to include SDI drawing references. Document Controller is required to file ALL As Built Drawings in the file arrangement as provided in the SDI on site. Please refer to ""TP 135 - Management of Electricity Transmission Asset Drawings"" and “TP135.04 SDI Template"" for more guidance and information. Advice going forward: 1. Survey SDI Structures - Compare SDI Structure provided on ECM against the one available on site (if applicable) [TP 135 Clause 3.4.1 applies]; 2. Raise the Question and Agree SDI Structure with client: 2.1. New Build - Not an add on existing NG Asset - confirm with client if SDI structure is to be created from scratch; 2.2. Major additions to an existing NG Asset - confirm with client if existing SDI structure is to be followed or produce a new one; 2.3. Amendments to NG Asset - depending on the scope of works it might be worth confirming with the client if additions to an existing SDI sub-section will suffice or if a full re-work to the current SDI is required; 3. SDI Ref on Drawing – Confirm with client the best suited location for the SDI reference on the Drawing Template depending on the filing system available on site (i.e. drawing rack or drawers) 4. Get Designers involved up front - Once point 1 to 3 are resolved, provide the numbering structure to the Designers to allow them to include the SDI reference while producing NG numbered drawings 5. File drawings on Stage by Stage Basis - Once As Built drawings are returned it would be best to file them on site as soon as practically possible to allow for distribution of workload"
"With multi discipline design requirements on the project, coordination between the different design houses involved has created an extra challenge. This has the potential to introduce layers of error. Preference would be to have a single source of design which will be the ""go to"" organisation dealing with the overall coordination.
"
"The below is example of checks which can be considered as part of Jointing ITP, and HV Cable Tunnels in particular, going forward. The list below could contribute to identifying items up front and will contribute towards items which will be on people's radar:
• Jointers certificates
• O&M manual
• HVC Accessories - Short circuit Straps 
• HVC Accessories - Details of different types of cleats 
• HVC Drawing
• HVC Accessories - Stand-off SVL bracket Details
• Drawing Details - Drawing showing all joint bay covers including those over joints 
• Drawing Types - Labelling
• Off-site Testing Supporting Documentation - Drawings referenced in routine test reports
• Final Inspection of Termination - Consider activity on Check Sheet outlining final visual inspection prior to release to PC/client"
"Failure to compare measured test results (Zero Sequence Impedance) with calculated Design figures whilst on site undertaking test works. If this had been carried out, a setup error from Kinectrics would have been noted and a re-test would have been done on the same day. Recommendation for all future cable testing works: Compare measured test values with theoretical design values whilst on site. Do not wait for the report phase to compare values."
"Lesson learnt for further works on the project or future projects will be the following: 
- Civils concrete ITP’s actively to detail in the parameters, that casting of the cubes to be completed by experienced personal or engineer. 
- Tool box on the cube making to be carried out. 
- Get the testing sub-contractors to carry out the casting and testing of the cubes under a PO.

"Delivery CL32 Programme management. Programme basics, schedule could not be matched to the actual site works delivery. Programme management methods depended on the delivery method selected, either waterfall or agile. Selection of agile methodology depends on client being part of project team. Daily scope and resources reviews may allow for better management of resources and scope gaps . This makes decision making quicker to drive dynamic delivery."
"Scope gaps of significant value, in excess of £600K resulted from failure to review M&E scope and get all this allocated to the M&E contractor in the Works Information and DOR."
"Fit To Start process not followed. The project still went ahead despite the Fit to start process not being followed, which makes the Fit To Finish not achievable."
"The issue related to Involving MPN design team, Baker Hicks Ltd and management of secondary design suppliers
 where no Design management philosophy in place to guide the alignment and including across design discipline interfaces. No alignment between design disciplines and the BKH consultant, which left the site works delivery programme exposed. This also resulted in BKH programme schedule overrun by more than 6 months."
"No package managers appointed to manage individual packages from project kick-off, a weakness inherited from failure to execute Fit To Start process as per organisation project delivery process. Package managers/engineers could have improved delivery through process monitoring and control. Package managers would have required clarity on their package management limits."
"Only ABB scope was accelerated after the TD. MES and building packages were not accelerated, which made the acceleration not practical as the GIS building had to be competed first before the GIS would be installed. Lack of full acceleration scope meant incorrect acceleration costs, programme performance and key programme dates management."
"At Tender stage, project delivery has already started. Planning and programmes are in place and agreed with the client, yet delivery team is not yet actively involved. The exclusion of the project delivery from tender stage leads to process failure and results in poor or no Fit to start kick-off. Inclusion of the project delivery team at late stages of tender process makes DOR practicable and reduces scope gaps as reviews are more tailored to delivery process."
6 weeks outage window is not enough time to deliver all the scope planned in the slot. This ties into the exclusion of the project delivery team from the late stages of the tender process. The outage delivery was supposed to be reviewed with all relevant delivery teams and interface areas explored to consider practicality of the programme. Mitigation included piling under live conditions and dynamic agile working.
"SGT4B outage window was too short for the planned scope and to make matters worse, the slot included the Christmas break where MPN and its suppliers are supposed to be on a break. This reflects lack of process and programme reviews which could have identified the anomaly and flagged this up with the client during tender stage."
Complex contract negotiations on complex scope. To speed up negotiations MPN de-scoped GIS female components with the intention to instructing NKT to supply them. This was not done. Possible reason for this was the lack of Scope Reviews/ Design Reviews and complex interface management.
Cables supplied without test ends. Cable protection timber is to be removed to sheath test cable on delivery leaving some cables exposed to damage for over one year
"Issue: Prior to agreeing to the supply of CBS to a project, proposed suppliers are required to demonstrate that their CBS meets the requirements specified in the contract (generally this is to ENATS 97-1 or NGTS 3.5.7). Due to a lack of engineering support, CBS suppliers were not engaged in a timely manner to confirm compliance of CBS for the Barking project. The result has been that CBS has had to be delivered to Barking from a quarry in Scunthorpe which had previously been confirmed as compliant for use on the Triton Knoll project. It should be noted that whilst the material delivered to site has been confirmed as compliant, the level of compaction achieved on site is slightly below that required to prove that the TR is compliant. Samples have been sent to a lab and are expected to confirm that the lower level of compaction still results in the TR requirements being met. Action required: • For future projects, the proposed backfill material compliance should be sought from suppliers prior to constructions works beginning • To confirm compliance on the Barking project, lab results are expected to be available prior to the 2020 Christmas break"
"“Snatching” of the cable (wrapping a strap around the oversheath of the cable and pulling it using the winch bond) resulted in damage during installation of SGT 4B, Blue Phase cable. Generally, when planning to snatch a cable prior to a bend, the cable shall have been pulled beyond the bend using the factory-fitted pulling eye. Snatching can then be performed to redivert the end of the cable into position. This reduces the amount of compression on the cable oversheath as the tension required to redivert the end of the cable is far less than the tension required to move the whole length of the cable, as was the case during the SGT 4B cable install. Actions undertaken: • Cable Installation RAMS to be updated to provide clarity that snatching cannot be used in situations where the full weight of the cable will be taken by the winch. Only the last portion of the cable can be taken after the cable has been pulled past the point of the bend • In order to better spread the compressive force applied to the cable during snatching, approved Cable Pulling Socks are to be used."
"Sheath Test Failure (SGT 3B – GIS Termination): A sheath test failure on SGT 3B was found to be a result of an inadequately prepared cable oversheath. Part of the jointing instruction includes a requirement to remove the conductive layer from the oversheath and perform an insulation resistance test across this area. The cable was subsequently re-scraped by the jointing subcontractor and a successful 10kV sheath test performed. Actions undertaken: 
• The existing Jointing QA form available on MIMS has been updated to include an insulation resistance test across the scrape of the oversheath"
"While taking the IMC panel into the UKPN relay room the operative saw that the tiles were lifting. Upon further investigation it was noted that the installation of the computer floor was not complete. JMS project have organised the responsible contractor to come on the morning of the 10/09/20 to resolve the issue provide corrective and preventive measures to avoid further complications. 
Actions: 
1. Engage with subcontractor at contract stage to ensure ITP's are provided and followed. Future subcontractors have been engaged at earlier stage and this process followed. 
2. Subcontractor to provide their hold/witness points as part of the they weekly activity schedule in advance. 
3. Lessons learnt created and implemented between MPN project team."
"During drilling through a brick wall to enable the installation of fire alarm siren light (located on the outer side of the building) it was observed that a significant section of the brick broke off as the drill bit exited the brick. This was seen on multiple locations. Furthermore, the same was observed when drilling to enable the entry for the water supply pipe into the GIS Building. Refer to photos attached. Action (to Prevent Reoccurance): - Look at using a different type of brick where items need to be placed. If a different brick is not possible mounting into the mortar shall be utilised with a recommended fixing."
"It was found that installed HV cable ducts for the SGT3B circuit with drawings that have not been fully co-ordinated between the design teams and installed the ducts without a signed ECI document granting the change in material from CBS surround to a concrete surround from our Client. Drawings issued for discussion from Bakerhicks were used for construction:
1. When a material or design change has been discussed on site, ensure this is communicated back to the design team. 
2. Then ensure any design change has a signed ECI document before starting works and brief the delivery project team on this. 
3. Discussions between the site and design teams at early stages of a design to identify specialist material requirements (testing), lead times and storage requirements. This is to be included in lessons learnt for the project."
"The provision of spare components is the responsibility of JMS as detailed in the contract. The requirement is also referenced in Technical Query 41. It has been highlighted that no spare HV components (cable or accessories) have been procured or ordered by JMS. Fit to start to incorporate ""spare parts"" or section that details equipment that needs to be purchased for the project. Capture this issue on the Lessons Learned to ensure this is passed to the next projects."
"When carrying out checks on the SGT1B ducting install, it was noticed the transposition point of SGT1B ECC duct had been missed. After discussions with the design team the installation was left and the transposition has been installed approx. 25m further along the route. This is currently being checked over by the design team for confirmation it is acceptable. Provide a hold point on future ITP's for HV ducting for the transposition of the ECC duct where applicable."
"There is a gap in the process where JMS P&C design department deems the installation of multicore and selection of multicore duct as the site team's responsibility. The duct allocation should come from the design team. T4b and upcoming works approach will be different with the JMS HV design team producing marked up drawings showing multicores and duct allocation. Subsequently, it will be submitted to JMS P&C design team for review from a cable rating point of view. Finally, it will be assessed by the pertinent cable pulling team or subcontractor."
"Adding water to concrete mix on site should be avoided at all costs. However, if for some reason Site Management is to consider to add water on-site to get the consistency to the desired slump a written approval from Project Manager is required."
"Following the delivery of structural steelwork for the cable tunnel brackets on site it was identified that:
-	Discolouration – green tinge observed on a number of the structures 
-	Scratches and scuff marks observed on the structures potentially caused through handling
-	Areas where galvanising has not adhered to the steelwork 
-	Excess zinc left on the structures and on the edges of the Steelwork causing sharp edges.

Proposed solution is to introduce a Hold Point on Subcontractors ITP to ensure that a post-galvanisation inspection is conducted prior to release of product for delivery"
"During the drilling of the cable tunnel support brackets the following issues were observed which we covered by two different NCR reports:
- Holes drilled were to deep which results in insufficient thread projection - affected 32 drilled holes
- Holes drilled were to deep resulting in water leaking through the rear of the brackets

Proposed actions to avoid this issue from happening again are circa:
- Ensure as accurate as possible information behind the tunnel wall thickness is obtained for the different sections
- If thicknesses defer between sections introduce a matrix-like schedule which might be used to coordinate lengths of drill which can be used
- Once lengths are established introduce a visible tape used to mark the maximum depth to which tunnel walls can be drilled
- Prior to commencement of the initial drilling, and where tunnel wall thickness defer, a TBT to be conducted reminding the site operatives of this issue"
"Following on an inspection by Local Water Distributor, as required to enable to installation and commissioning of the water supply pipe, it was observed that design provided by Baker Hicks differed from the Water Regulator requirements. From investigation and correspondence with supplier, it became evident that the designer has considered the overall Water Regulation requirements, however did not take into considerations the additional requirements outlined by the local water distributor.

Potential actions to consider for the future:
- At Design stage, where connection to local distributors is required, query if any additional requirements have been considered. This could be applicable to local distribution networks in: water, sewage, electricity, gas, communications;
- At construction stage, query if local distribution requirements are applicable. Extract requirements are reflect them on relevant ITP for the works. Consider requirement to issue ITP to local distributor for information/review. Introduction of Hold Points might be an effective way to resolve this issue.

"Structural Steelwork units produced to support the Cable Sealing Ends, Air Insulated Switchgear and Earth Switches have generated number of issues due to lack of design coordination between the different disciplines and/or parties requiring equipment to be installed on the structures. Details below:

Design was checked with the cables and equipment supplier for the alignment with the pcd of the cable still being maintained centrally within the CT and the Sealing End., Inclusion of an interface performer when submitting the enquire to the designers/manufacturer. Greater clarity on the interface points with documentation from designers correctly referenced and highlighted to define the technical details required to be considered. Naming reference for documentation needs to be clear when co-ordinating through interdisciplinary reviews. This is so that the designated engineers/designers can correctly view/identify the specific details of the components and not have the documentation be subjective."
"GRP covers supplied as covers for the HV Cable troughs as required by NG SCT 36 do not match latest drawing dimension. Going forward the following points could be considered to avoid this issue from happening again:
- Survey of as built structure before ordering new covers
- Lead time for procurement of covers is to be considered in conjunction with the pre-requisite above
- Overall programme to consider points outlined above in predecessor sequence with relation of pulling the activity earlier in the programme to accommodate the required time"
"The steel infill covers have been delivered to site with an 8mm internally threaded rivet nut. Drawings state 12mm earthing hole. A TQ has been raised to confirm that this is acceptable. TQ reply as per the below:
""There is no requirement for a minimum bolt size for bonding connections. Provided the connection is made
with corresponding lug and washer size to the bolt, and the earth conductor size is as specified the
connection will be acceptable."""
"Some cover support beams do not have earthing holes in sufficient location. Drawings have holes noted, however not all holes are noted. This resulted in the site team drilling the additional holes:

Proposed actions are:
- More in-depth drawing review requires to be undertaken
- Introduction of a multi-disciplinary review, with focus at discipline interface points in particular"
"During pre-start inspection conducted by Sudkabel (Cable Jointers) it was identified that the scaffold enclosure at Beddington had multiple water leaks following from heavy rainfall from the previous night. The water leaks were identified on numerous locations particularly where the Monoflex sheeting laps over the shrink wrap at the high level platform. 

Proposed action to mitigate this issue going forward is to add as an additional requirement/note on the RAMS - Heat shrink layer should be finished down a further platform level on the scaffold to create a larger over lap between the heat shrink and the Monoflex layer.



"
"It was noted during a post-installation visual inspection of the SGT 4B Blue Phase cable that deformation and a slight kink was present on the cable (See NCR Photo 1). The location of the deformation was on the approach into the GIS Undercroft adjacent to the GIS Building.

Cable entry into the GIS undercroft is via a concrete duct bank, through which a chain block from the GIS Hall's overhead gantry crane is attached to the nose of the cable to guide it through the GIS Undercroft and into position next to the termination. In order to gain slack for the gantry crane to take up, a sling was fixed to the bond of the cable winch and the sling wrapped around the cable in order to ""snatch"" the cable using the cable winch.

Proposed action to mitigate the issue going forward is to amend cable installation methodology, specifically the ""snatching"" of the cable and arrangement of the sling on the cable oversheath, to be reviewed / amended to reduce / eliminate the risk of damage to the cable during installation. Cable Install Toolbox talk to be carried out prior to cable install for the next outage."
"A winch used to pull cable along a cable route should print out the tension from the winch on the cable. The print out shows how much tension is on the cable at different lengths throughout the pull. This is used to ensure that the tension on the cable does not exceed the permissible limit for the cable.

The first record out of three cable pulls is missing, so there is not record for tensions on the red phase cable during installation.

Proposed action to avoid the issue from happening again is to introduce an activity to the ITP, as a Hold Point, outlining the requirement to test printing of winch. Also a TBT can be conducted prior to activity commencing to remind the site team of the required activities."
"Following an audit conducted by NG regarding how design changes are managed it was identified that procedure around how design changes are identified, assessed, recorded and corrective action allocated to administer the change.

It was agreed during a lessons learnt session held on 9/11/21 by the majority of the joint PET/HUN team present that the project would benefit from a 'On Site' document controller. Although the project is to remain with a remote document control team (PHDC) it was suggested that the business should consider recruiting a on site document controller for future projects. It was discussed that this would benefit communication between project & DC teams as well as dealing with urgent queries etc 
"Circuit Grid T4B, AIS Termination clash between bonding lead, slip-over Current Transformer and Cable Sealing End structure meant the bonding lead could not be installed through the CT as per design. The issue arose due to the correct CT dimensions not being carried across to HV Cable system design package. Therefore the space allowed for the bonding lead was not there. 

Following design change procedure, a plate was installed between the structure and CT to offset the CT and hence allowing more room for the bonding lead to pass through and on to the termination.

LL:
- Engineer on site to check interface between CT/ CSE structure and HV components prior to installation and termination works being carried out. All steelwork for Barking project has been delivered to site.
- Same steelwork and CT used for similar circuit Grid T1B, solution to be agreed with client and implemented in advance of the outage. Grid T1B steelwork already on site. 

"
"Following completion of jointing works on AIS 132kV termination on Barking Grid T4B circuit, engineer inspection noted oil on the termination and raised it as a suspected oil leak. Investigation indicated that no oil had leaked and this oil had been from a spillage outside the termination. The result of the investigation was no further action was required.

LL: Although correct investigation procedure had taken place, for future circuits the jointing works are to be fully inspected immediately after the works are complete with the jointers present. In this case, the scaffold and sheeting had potentially made the oil difficult to be noticed. Flashlights should be used if the surroundings are dark. Condition of termination is to be agreed by both principle contractor and subcontractor (Jointing team) prior to any removal of scaffolding."
"Steelwork required for the Grid T4B outage was not procured for the project. Following a redesign, additional steelwork was required for circuit Grid T4B to support the cable aboveground. 

The steelwork was noted as a required item by the site team and the site team where expecting the delivery of all Grid T4B to arrive just before the outage. When going to install the additional steelwork it was noted as missing. Investigation found out that this steelwork had been designed but not approved for fabrication so had not been procured for the project. The steelwork was procured at additional acceleration cost and was installed in time for HV testing. The steelwork was not ready for HV Cable install, so had to be installed after the fact. 

LL:
All steelwork to be checked when delivered to site 
If any item is being delivered close to use, engineer to confirm with order note that everything required is being delivered
Individual steelwork pieces to be broken up on the procurement schedule to note different deliveries"
Ensure as-built drawings production is captured within scope of supplier.
Having the client embedded as the enterprises can be challenging as they are still seen as the client. Then the client gives instructions as a member of the enterprise it can be conflicting to what Murphy leaders say say. Things as simple as being told to get new PPE by a NG member of the enterprise doesn’t always align with the agreement with Murphy 
An apprentice has not had the opportunity to get out and experience the site works enough 
Setting up new suppliers and contractors can be frustrating as it takes so much time

Not enough people on the job at the start as we were not fit to start and signed the contract late and just turned up 
"Standard of the supply labour is not consistent. Some can be good, but some do not last. It can be challenging as setting people on the jobs takes time and costs. The feedback is fed into the supply chain company.  "
Concrete supplier was not set up before the team started on site. The local suppliers were fully booked as the industry rose
Pre ordering concrete works well. 8 loads a day delivered like clockwork. Highlights the importance of ore-orders and having the right information 
Arco PPE order and taken over 9 weeks. When two weeks is the delivery time
Understood at tender stage that only £70 per head was allow a for PPE
Any amendments/changes take a very long time. Around 4 weeks to get any amendments 
Individual costs spent on time dealing with design changes is hard to calculate 
Design issues have meant double working in some cases. Concrete outs have been removed in some situations 
"Belief that the previous contractor was still designing the job when they were removed, which is why the design is causing so many challenges "
Vac ex operators were exceptional and integrated with the team well
The utilisation is VacEx across two projects would have covered the cost for plant to buy a VAC EX
The teams on site are knowledgeable and understand why the temp works are needed and carry out the works as required. This makes managing the TW better for the engineers 
No relationship with previous contractor had a huge impact on the delivery of the job 
"Concrete was delivered to site , 
Initial delivery checks were carried out, on the delivery note to confirm correct mix design, batching details etc
Upon pouring out a sample for slump testing there was a discrepancy in the overall colour,... It was not GRAY, but a colour mixed with a pink dye, (obviously not possible)"
"Daily briefs do not include all the team, only supervisors are involved due to size of the whole team "
Supply chain partners are not always included in the briefings and feedback Fridays. Which can lead to confusion on site as to where works are being carried out 
4pm meeting is missed more than it’s done
"Challenges are only discovered at the last minute as it is work that the previous contractor installed, and works can be frustrating to the site teams doing the work"
Resource needing to go onto other Murphy jobs may be a challenge as the knowledge here has been built up over time 
As the resource reduces the work remaining needs to be considered and achievable
Toolbox talks are now being done out live on site and delivered in a way which is more appealing to the site team
Only one safety team member here from the start 
Supervisors have had a good mentality towards safety which has been an asset
Subcontractors do not always have the same mentality as the Murphy team
The method of construction for cable concrete draw pits has worked well and as expected 
Signage into the compound is not adequate but is controlled by the neighbouring contractor 
Having the training room on site has been a real asset 
"SCO, first aid, PASMA, quick hitch, abrasive wheels, fire marshals, and SSTS have been done "
SHEA has held every month on site 
Project support being on site has helped make the recess of ordering more efficient 
Delivery teams have been efficient 
From a supply chain point of view the site team are approachable 
No major incidents 
Depending on which gang you are in depends on if you get the feedback from and supervisor briefings. Operatives often need to ask before they are told 
Team leaders carrying out supervisor roles and signing as a supervisor 
All roles should have site exposure to better support the from to back delivery ethos

Stage 1 & Stage 2 design this should be mapped out in the DID but suggest the strategy is defined early and in as much detail as possible to ensure buy in from all sides of the project. Once agreed and written down, this should be used as the terms of reference for any assurance so any deviation can be tracked and managed."
"•	Freeze DID early - with all packs agreed, detail contents of design packs – agree with NG.  Also worth outlining the assurance strategy and mapping out expectations for how the Consultant, Contractor and OEM designs will be signed off. Also, need to consider a strategy for any temporary works as M&E temp works is different to civils and may attract NG assurance interest.

"•	FSES BR2 has undertaken some detailed CFD modelling to prove the risk of fire from the cables in extremely low. Therefore, only considered fire risk is from hand tools/ batteries taken into the tunnel. This potentially avoids more onerous operation, transportation and evacuation constraints by using a more realistic approach.

•	Tunnel vehicle? Is an electric trike specified for LPT2? This was trialled at BR2 for suitability. BR2 are proposing to use the trike for transportation of workforce and equipment only. Due to the distance between shafts and low risk FSES, it was deemed that escape can be by foot as this meets the 30 min criteria. Trike could utilised but is not mandatory. If LPT2 mandates the need for the trike to be used for escape and/ or transportation of emergency then a stretcher would need to be attached. These are bespoke items that will need to be prototyped and tested by the right manufacturer as the trikes have limited approved accessories. All of this equipment will need to be lifted into/ out of the shaft via the headhouse so space planning for the lifting process needs coordination."
"•	3d modelling: If using 3D/ Revit for space planning, ensure all OEM and contractor design elements are properly represented on the model so the room layouts can be reviewed for clash detection and Operational Access and Maintenance requirements.

"At beddington substation when using a MGF manhole support box during the excavation of a pumping chamber, an adjacent 275kv cable trough was undermined. There was existing services that clashed with the box, the senior engineer (TWS) contacted specialist to divert. But they were not available till the following week. TWS contacted MGF and was told they could use a smaller length struts. The struts where swapped over and the excavation recommenced that day. A couple of days later the works where stopped by client who observed material displacement under adjacent cable trough, during the site visit.       
All works civils works in beddington HV compound where suspended till a solution was found and agreed with the client. After a number of months of work shops and rams reviews a solution was agreed and repairs works took place.
Route cause 
The support box was not installed as per rams and TW design dig and push method. As most of excavation was completed previously for the cable sealing end (CSE) trough, the area should have been backfilled to trough foundation level.  
The TWC was not informed of the changes to box size, till it was swapped over.
By reducing the size of the box it meant the box was moved 700mm away from the trough. This added to ground been able to move, when originally design was the box would be 50-100mm way from the trough.
The TWS, was not on site at the time on day, the works stopped. The process of appointing site foreman as TWS was taking place. 
Lessons learnt 
Rams and TW design must be adhered to at all times.
If changes are required even minor, it must go through the TWC as per JMS TW process.
Preplanning of excavation works should have of taken place. Known service where identified in the design process.
Insure that is TWS cover in place, when TWS supervising the works was going to be absent.

This board should have all the required information and documents needed to facilitate this work - permits, calibration certs of equipment, drawing of layout, radio charging points, Gas monitor charging points etc."
•	Welfare at HH locations - utilise power supplier and water connections where possible. Detail out welfare provisions to Supply chain explicitly. 
Central office rented rather than temp set up - for the duration of a project like this more permanent offices would have been more ideal. the requirement for maintenance is less in a permanent set up than temp office set ups etc.
•	Commissioning support – JMS need a commissioning manager/ Eng that understands and manages the entire process. Given the size of this you may need more than one. Ensure that there is early coordination between the design development and the commissioning panel and that design changes are tracked carefully and reported to the CPMs. 
Prioritise the use of directly employed staff as they will have the drive and commitment to deliver the project.
"•	Quality of work needs to be addressed – what’s acceptable by Murphy and challenging our supply chain partners even with limited timescales.

"Following a review of As-built drawing records on site at Barking, it was identified to the project team that printed As-built drawings where not in accordance to TP135’s drawing management procedure due to a number of drawings being printed As-built and filed in colour as per original design drawing.

TP135 clause 3.5.3. e), reads; 
“Upon completion of site works, all finalised As-installed master drawings submitted to National Grid 
must fully conform to the requirements stated in 3.5.3. ‘“

In addition, same clause;

“Black and white content to be PDF'd to Monochrome not Greyscale, Colour content to be PDF'd colour where only colour display on Hardcopy 
mages is required.”

Upon initial investigation, a number of drawings received from our design consultants, BakerHicks and Hitachi Power Grids (ABB), following As-built updates have returned to Murphy drawings in colour which as a project team we have printed to store on site for record. This is a shortfall in adhering to the technical procedure and as a result a series of none-conformance will be raised identifying the issue. 

As a project team we have missed a step (a hold point) prior to issuing these drawings to be printed/processed, to be received as a hard copy drawing on site. The TP is clear that this process should happen at the As-built stage, and this should happen with our designers. In this instance with Barking, ABB and BakerHicks should have processed the drawings in Monochrome prior to issuing to JMS, we have failed to pick this up. 

Following meetings with the clients Project Engineer and Quality Manager, the agreed action is that we shall return these drawings back to the designers and have them corrected as per TP135 As-built issuing, and we raise 2 NCR’s. 1 on JMS for not picking this up and proceeding to print, and 1 to our designers as they too have failed to provide correct As-built drawings in accordance with TP135.

As a lesson learnt from this experience, we have not fully adhered to the technical procedure as a result of trying to be efficient and hastily returning the drawings back to site upon receipt of our consultants updates. The drawings are none-compliant as As-built records, by challenging this with our client, we would lose our integrity shown to date at being compliant.

For complex integrated design, the consultants should be employed by the main contractor. 

If it is necessary to employ the M&E sub contractor before the detailed design is completed, the to control costs, the M&E contractor could be employed to review design. Otherwise the M&E sub contractor should be procured once the design is suitable for construction. 

Those elements of the design that are beyond or outside the skillset of the consultant, possibly by reason of limitation on their professional indemnity, specialist contractors/manufacturers can be employed to develop those components. 

Those elements of work that need interface drawings, should not typically require assurance review unless there is some sort of process involved. These drawings would be completed in the as built documentation.

"Failure to compare measured test results (Zero Sequence Impedance) with calculated Design figures whilst on site undertaking test works. If this had been carried out, a setup error from Kinectrics would have been noted and a re-test would have been done on the same day. Recommendation for all future cable testing works: Compare measured test values with theoretical design values whilst on site. Do not wait for the report phase to compare values."
"Design and Change Control

Design change process needs to be embedded early into the project design process. It also needs communicating and regular reporting/ review with operations, commercial and programme teams to understand any contractual notifications that need to be applied to the client or sub contractos, designers etc. assistance may be required from design management to help provide context of issues to other funcitons so recommend that DM lead and coordinate this process."
"creating a duck under in an existing substation environment can result in signficant civil works, especially when there are HV circuits crossing due to ratings issues. This should be assessed at an early stage to understand extent of work required. At Beddington the issue was compounded by high water table and deep excavation so pumping system had to be added. space limitations due to existing assets and phasing of outages also made the issue complex. The complexity also meant that there needed to be a strong interface between the temporary and permanent works."
"A regular discussion is required with the NG assurance team to ensure any design assurance strategy is still valid for the project or needs amending. On BR2 the M&E elements took a long to time to define with the client and their specialists with nobody willing to make a decision. this needs to be mapped out early between design management, LCDAE and the NG assurance team."
Ensure batching time is given so we can gauge 2 hours from batching to comply with spec
"Title: Bank of cables, which were not detailed on any NG service plans

Cables should not be laid in spoil heaps

Cables or services that can’t be traced should be laid with a tracer cable, or traceable warning tape

The cables would not have been identified with GPS, as GPS works on ground disturbance, for example a trench line. The whole spoil area has been disturbed. 

For example, services that are not traceable, unarmoured fibre optics, plastic gas pipes. These will also not be traced by GPS if they are buried in spoil heaps, or if they are moled. "
"Recommendation to prevent occurrence would be to advise during design package submission of the testing requirements to the piling methodologies if applicable to avoid the confusion and potential of integrity testing not being completed where required.

It was found that the site might not be able to supply this requirements which means we have to do further investigations and raise a concession.  There might be other option of Star link but this option is not guaranteed. 
To ensure this don't happen again it would be good practice and do the upfront investigations before acceptance of the IT requirements and identify if the sites can provide the customers IT requirements.

"A process that would ensure more formal engagement with supply chain partners prior to actual site work to be put in place to make a robust arrangement that would ensure seemless flow of information between Murphy and its supply chain partners.
This and other forms of engaging supply chain partners on a fromal level would assist in ensuring contractual obligations are carried out as contained inthe contract and both parties would understands what roles they are meant to play in the execution of contract."
Early adoption of Aconex Field was not applied from the first record of inspection makes compilation of records at a later date more disjointed.  The use of Aconex Field at the end of the project is easier to collate records.
Airsweb EcoOnline or Alcumus do not raise actions on external users.  This will make it not possible for the user to access and complete the action.  In the case of Airsweb EcoOnline the action will have to be deleted and reissued as it cannot be changed back to an internal user.  
"Whilst setting up an FAT for equipment with supplier.  It is good practice to have a Pre-FAT meeting to discuss the way this will be conducted.  Ensuring ITP and any FAT Procedure is fully approved and understood.  Conveying to the supplier the need for Competency Records, Calibration Records for any equipment used in build and test including crimping tools, torque wrenches, Multi-meters, Scopes, etc and any Routine Testing records that may have been done, template for the report to be submitted for the FAT.  This will ensure expectations are planned and that the supplier knows to walk us through the testing explaining each stage as we progress."

On several work packages Premtech have developed their designs using a point cloud from a laser scan without checking the elevation details on site. This has led to several work packages where the supports proposed in the design have had to be modified at site to get them to fit. This first occurred in June 2021, but its now been noted that these issues affect multiple work packages so there is an error in the design process somewhere as the 3D model that the designs are based off does not reflect reality of what is at site.

It has been observed that having a permanent Document controller on site would benefit the project allowing documentation to issued to clients with out delay and also allow doc con to be more involved in projects. This has worked in the past when Doc con have been on site
"On Braybrooke we don't have a Storeman or yard man who's responsibilities is to look after site i.e., barriers, housekeeping and stores. The site manager has all the responsibility which leads to other areas lacking in attendance.  Projects should be allocated with enough resources to cover all activities."
Train operatives to be competent in earth tape instead of waiting for a subcontractor coming to site multiple visits.  This will save time and money for the project.
Keep the same teams together to get a better output and understanding on the next project because everyone knows how each other work plus strengths and weaknesses. This will also support less turnover in staff.
"When Aconex is available it should be utilised. NG has signed up to Aconex but does not use it.  This makes it a risk of loosing communication and documents.  This will also help a lot when documents (ITP's, RAMS etc) are sent for review an approval - Traceability and make the handover easier."
Commissioning engineers programme.  Needs resources (In-house) to produce the programme for commissioning. We don't have in-house expertise.

"To be thought of and forecasted before the start of the project as much as possible.  Involve the correct subject matter experts for example site manager, superintendent, PM, Design etc.."
Draw pits on site are a problem in size and depth for access. Example a draw pit is 2.6m deep with cables so access is limited.  Thought needs to be given to those that needs to access the pits.
"The use of ditches instead of drainage and manholes. This would save on materials, time and cost as you would not need to use concrete and plastic.  This is also an environmental friendly method."
Make sure that the local watermain is checked asap to ensure there is water supply when required. Refer to the Rainwater harvester solution.
Use Sub contractors for the main concrete structures rather than site resources as this will save time and money as the contractors will utilise their own resources and will deliver on time.  This will also support JMS resources not to be utilised in one area and could continue working according to the programme. 
Train Storeman and anyone accepting goods from suppliers on relevant regulations for example CE/CA Marked products.
Under resourced - Output has been very good considering the small teams of operatives on site and that have been competent in their work but the forecast throughout the project has been a question and needs to be resourced correctly going forward in future projects. 
Consider making allowances at benefit analysis for overtime works in the summer months to mitigate the impact of winter inefficiencies. This will eventually be a positive for the project as we will deliver on time.

Vegetation left in place to severed areas enabled environmental controls to be made and evaluated as/when required - DCO requirements.
Set Scaffold platforms as per SHR3 works – The bottom scaffold deck was installed 300mm lower than HINK/MELK/SHR1. This allowed oil tanks to be installed without scaffold amendments to notch around oil tanks. The oil tanks did not encroach into level 2.   This assisted in the efficiency of the termination works.
CSE structures to be manufactured with detachable (bolted) cross arms when CT install is required. This will reduce the amount of cable manipulation required when slipping over CT’s - assisting in ease of install.
CT Packer plates – Siemens CT dimensions differed to ARUP design resulting in packers being required to allow termination bonding lead to pass through CT opening. CT dimensions to be verified before proceeding to construction status  
Provide clear communication of HV testing times with adequate notice. 15-30 minutes was not adequate during BB testing as other works within the substation could not be safely stopped at such short notice – Scaffolding etc. JMS therefore implemented a 1 hr notice prior to commencing HV testing. All parties were made aware of the anticipated test times on the days prior to HV testing.

When originally engaging with the supplier communication was held but crucial question were not asked with regards to there terminology.  We have been asking for example 8+ concrete expecting a second wagon and this for the local Hanson branch is actually a wagon on turn around. this has caused extra delays in report writing and could have led to concrete being removed
At the start of projects get multiple approved suppliers into the system to allow for better preparedness for when plants can not supply or for multiple pours across site. Also when completing this ensure plants are with in sensible traveling time as lost time from batching to site has a knock on affect to the amount of time on site. 
"Due to many changes of personnel on site, close out of paperwork has become difficult on occasions with the amount of staff changes at site management level. 3 x project manager, 3 x QA, 5 x engineers,"

Ensure review of tower bracing positioning and link box steelwork positioning in conjunction with actual cable terminations and bonding lead location – issues noted at AT33 tower.  It was not possible to retain the link box positions as all central in line with the terminations due to the cable positioning through the basket floor and tower bracing.  The tower at AT33 was supplied/installed by Norpower and additional steel plates were installed as part of MPNL works – see drawing HINK-ARUP-CV-XX-DR-X-7201.  Final locations for link boxes to be marked up on as built drawings.
Design reviews require improvements to verify that the design has been made in accordance with the supplier information. JMS are currently liaising with ARUP on how this is best achieved.

"To attempt to get a head of time in the programme, Commissioning of items on a temporary power supply was used as the mains power was not ready at the time. Due to a difference in phase rotation this has actually created more issues once the power supply was connected correctly, site has had to re commission items as they had chattering solenoids that have needed to be re commissioned. The Lesson to be shared is to always commissioning on the permanent power supply."
"On review of requirements for concrete protection slab by the site team and liaising with the designers, it was discovered that laying pipes/ducting to lower depth would provide the required protection for the pipes/ducting.
Concrete protection slabs worth over £40,000 was projected earlier for the project.  
Reviewing design and questioning/challenging in a constructive way by the site/construction team would be beneficial to the business.
Also carrying the construction team along in relevant areas of design would be useful for achieving cost-effective designs."
Review of documentation is managed via Aconex.  Lead reviewers are nominated for different documents however when there is absenteeism or lead reviewer is unable to conduct the a review within the time frame no substitute reviewer is being nominated and communicated to document control leading to delay in approval of documentation for site works.
"When items was ordered from the supplier they were issued with a drawings and a purchase order.  The drawings did not specify all the lengths information required (Top bar of a the barrier).  The text in the PO did describe the length required but the bar still came incorrect as it was left to interpretation and assumption. It is important that we provide the suppliers with enough detail ie detail/measurements/type etc. on the drawings that correspond with the purchase order and ensure that the supplier provides an order acknowledgements.  If there is any discrepancy on the requirements the detail should be questioned, and no items procured until clarity is received.  "

Tool Box talk given regarding need to revise Murphy Ground Engineering methods of carrying out slump tests for piling activities.
Method statement briefing sheets are saved in a folder but not scanned into the project F:/ for future evidence if required.  The risk of loosing those briefing documents are high once the project comes to completion.

Employers Quality requirements were not understood for example submission dates for various documents that needed to be reviewed. Before a project starts it is important to provide sufficient contract requirement training (Workshops or project opening up meetings) communicating to the team and ensuring that everyone on the team in every department understand the Employer and agreed requirements. 
"To many concession request when the company aims and works to a Right first time approach. Example of Concession requests.
1. JMS were unable to meet the minimum requirements of communications system and the provision of a 4g system within the area.  Redcar and Cleveland will not support a communication system of this speed. (Minimum ranged at upload (20mb/s) and downloads speeds (100Mb/s) or greater)
2. Minimum cover depth of ditch crossings to be reduced from 2900mm to 1500mm.
3.Utilise a 202mm mandrel for the 250(OD)/237(ID)mm duct proving operations for both the SOWF and DBC circuits.
Have a collaborative approach at bidding stage, ensure all disciplines are in attendance to avoid misunderstandings later. The SME's should be giving input if requirements and objectives can be met.  Challenges and TQ's should be raised and addressed before the contract is agreed as it will avoid confusion and frustration.  Save time and money in the long run and support the Right First time ethos in Murphy's.  "
Documents used were not always the latest revisions used or downloaded from internal MIMS.  This meant that documents had to be re written onto the correct revision.   Always download the correct and latest revision from MIMS. 
When the storeman started in the stores there were no evidence that he received COSHH training even though he was responsible for the COSHH stores. It is important that all resources starting in positions on JMS Projects receives the correct training including JMS process training before the project starts.  The training needs to be recorded and available as and when requested. It will be good practice to do process training at least annually to ensure any changes was communicated and the training is captured to continue competency is monitored.
"GW6, GW7 and GW9 - Fit to Finish plan. The project had not implemented a fit to finish plan when the project started.  It is important to implement the process at the same time the project starts as it identifies important information like RACI matrix, deliverables etc… The Document should also be an agenda point in the internal coordination meeting to ensure everyone has a clear view of what they are responsible to deliver and when. Potentially have a separate deliverable meeting.
"
"JMS has not run an open point system (NCR tracker) as stated in the Employers requirements. The on boarding of a Quality manager earlier in the project ie start up stage, may have prevented this issue as the Employers requirements information would have been available to him/her to ensure all requirements were implemented and met."
"It was found that material received was not conforming to required specification.  It is important that when material is received on site weather it is from internal procurement or sub-contractor material, the items are checked against the delivery note and C of C’s by a JMS representative.  The QA checks should also be identified on the ITP as a hold point which supports Quality Control.  If any material is found not to the required standard the material is rejected and an NCR raised and monitored on the Alcumus system. (NCR Process followed)"
There was early engagement with Supply chain where they identified their requirements including items required additional consent to be applied for example abstraction and discharge licence.  The information was not communicated to the correct team which put them under additional amount of pressure to achieve required start date.  It is important that information firstly gets communicated and secondly gets communicated to the right teams/individuals.
"The project started with no tool to monitor and control the ITP requirements for example what ITP is required, when the ITP is required and when the ITP needed to be submitted for internal and Employers review.  This led to NCR’s/open points raised due to ITP’s being submitted late and not within the employers Quality requirements timeframes.  It is important that the ITP tracker tool is set up before the project starts.  It is important that the tracker identifies ITP’s for both internal and suppliers for the project, when they are required and when they should be submitted to the employer."
"Whilst conducting Monthly internal Audits and Quality site inspections, it was found that ITP’s were not always signed off by all the relevant parties and the ITP’s did not always reflect live status.  The site engineer is responsible for keeping the ITP live with current works.  This is important to keep up to date as there might be some hold and witness points that must be signed off before the works can continue and ensure employer is accepting the work completed.  ITP’s must be kept concurrent with live activities."
Inconsistencies in programme between projects (JMS & Employer) not identifying document requirements. Utilise the fit to finish plan and review/audit as part of the audit schedule.
Collaborative working with the Employer. Example provided was doing a lesson learned and sharing ideas on how JMS can improve the way of supporting the employer and completing the works provided.
Reaction to issues raised by the Employer for example ITP’s being issued outside of employers requirements timeframes and RCA completed and information provided to the employer on time has been positive and the Employer was satisfied.  
Managements – Supervision and communications skills with direct operatives (Interactions) have been very professional.  This includes operators having conversations with senior management.  
Procurement has been able to do a more resourcing in the Northeast region.  Supports a stronger supply chain.  This was all possible by a Sofia led event which JMS attended.
Sub-Contractors work has not always been undertaken with as close scrutiny as the CONTRACTOR’s direct work. Need to ensure there is enough resources for example a Quality Controller. This will help support the Quality control on the project whether it be in goods in or when work is completed by sub-contractors.  
"During a Calibration Audit at the Sellindge Site s was observed that the Calibration Co-Ordinator had integrated the sub-contractors calibration records into the ""Master"" Project Calibration Register (Best Practice), this is not common practice across all projects."
"If a Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDP) is not used on a project, a detailed Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) tracker must be put in place to monitor production of ITPs and to assist in ensuring the approved / accepted ITP is available in readiness for the start of the works.  This will help the project submit ITP's on time and avoid potential NCR's or delays in work starting."
Employers are not always familiar with how works need to be done and the requirements that goes with the job. When an ITP is written and accepted it is beneficial to have a collaborated presentation before the work commences with the employer/client on the works that is to be completed.  The presentation should provide key information about the installation and quality requirements and the presentation should be delivered in a way which is easy to understand with photos and diagrams showing step by step how activities should be carried out including completion of assurance records.  This takes removes confusion and provides the opportunity to ask questions. Could save the project unnecessary delays and cost.
"Project do not capture hours and cost associated to Project NCR's, the Alcumus system RCA tab calls for actual costs and hours, currently we seem to put a ""finger in the air"" and guess this, ultimately giving the business a false figure for COPQ"
"The use of RET50 Admixture within the piling concrete mix. The RET50 Admixture is used for a 4-hour open life on the concrete.
In the cold weather below 0 degrees Celsius, the freezing temperatures caused the admixture to congeal therefore blocking the pipes within the batching plant preventing any concrete deliveries being batched.  "
"The early removal of Quality Control function from site.
QC was removed from the Sellindge IFA site in Aug / Sep of 2022, resulting in on-site inspections ceasing, subsequently the project has had a major issue with non compliant brickwork on the stairwells which would have potentially been picked up if QC had been present."
Vendor document deliverables register is sometimes missed out on the Purchase order and this leaves the Supply chain partner with less information or specific information on what the deliverables are. VDDR should form an integral part of the PO as this will allow the supply chain partner to implement and deliver/discharge their responsibilities as per specification.
"Issue

Pipework was tested to the test pressure of 177.23 Bar instead of 147.61 Bar. In doing so SMYS of pipe material (L360) exceeded 105%. This takes the permitted pressure outside the safe working limits of TD/1.

Mitigation 

A calculation based on IGEM/TD1 Edition 5 section 8.2.2.4 was carried out using the actual pipe yield of 445 N/mm2 and pressure of 177.23
barg which corresponded to 102% SMYS which is below the 105% maximum permitted. Based upon the calculation a TQ was raised & submitted to the client for
review & acceptance. Client approved the TQ on 30th September 2022.

"Making it clear to all site personnel that the joint tags are there for a reason. If they need to break out a joint, they need to speak with the person who is named on that joint tag or P.T.S personnel. They then also need to take the joint Tag back into the flange manager who can record that the joint has been broken out."
"A detailed Quality Investigation Root Cause Analysis form has been created, implemented and is being used at the Sofia Project. This provides a step by step approach for undertaking a detailed root cause analysis. using tools such as 5 Whys and the Fishbone diagram and summarising the recommendations which result from the investigation.  The document was issued to the senior Quality manager to implement into MIMS"

"On 8th September 2022 JMS took delivery of the workshop steelwork coated with fire resistant paintwork. It was noted at the time that this steel work had previously been delivered to site but due to defects in the coating rejected and returned to the manufacturer (see report dated 9th May 2022). On inspection a number of further defects were noted that suggested that surfaces had not prepared correctly before repainting and beams had been stacked before paint had cured fully (see photographs) and a JMS NCR raised (Ref. 2578). 

During a site visit on 4th October, it was observed that rather than addressing the defects at the workshop under a controlled environment or at site before erection, this steel work had now been erected to form the workshop framework without the defects previously identified having been addressed. In addition, storage of the beams still awaiting election was seen to be poor with pooling of surface water on visible defects which over time is likely to cause further damage.

Upon reviewing this case it was discovered that no Inspection and test plan was in place and Murphy had not witnessed any of FPC activities."
"An inspection of the Sellindge Staircases  1 & 2 brickwork highlighted the wall was built out of the Plumbness specification, on  SC1 and SC2 the east walls are out of tolerance and were leaning to the east and the north wall of SC2 and south walls of VH1 were also out of specification, this resulted in both walls having to be dismantled.
Further investigation found ITP the checksheets were poorly populated and where the checksheets had identified the walls being out of specification it was checked as a ""Pass""

On speaking with the site team it was highlighted that the ITP & Checksheets had not been briefed to the team before the original start of works, it was obvious there is a lack of understanding of the ITP and checksheets."
"Murphy opted to export  pups to a supplier as free issue and this resulted to delays in the delievery of final equipment.

"Performance requirements of Rotork Actuators, within spec but NGT Client request quicker travel.
Review of original contract, open and closing times specifications of under 30 seconds were communicated to Rotork. Actuators were designed and built as requested. Actuator hydraulic Orifice restrictor plates were removed to improve travel times once the actuator was installed and function tested. 
There is a perception by terminal operations that the actuator is not performing as expected, this has been taken from past experience where the actuator closed the valve rapidly slamming shut within 15 seconds. Delays and suspension of the actuator programme until investigation has been carried out on valve stem, new stem keyway and actuator function test."

"During the handover phase it was highlighted that the vast majority of the inspection checksheets / site documentation was hard copies only, due to the site being demobilised at short notice the binders containing the documentation were boxed and transported to several different locations, this made it very difficult to collate the handover documentation.

Lessons learned is to scan checksheets / site documentation ""as you go""."
During the review / alignment of the handover documentation (ITP Checksheets) it was highlighted that some personnel are saving scanned documents locally on their C Laptops rather than on the Project Hub.
"It was advised in the Purchase order that Unique Idetification Number will be tagged on Pig Signallers and Identified on all documentations, however, approved general Arrangement Drawings did not reference Tag/UIN. There appears to be gap in communication between parties involved in raising Purchase Order and those reviewing&approving drawings. Multi-disciplinary review of documents needs to be encouraged."
"It was highlighted by the NG team that they required the Fibre cables used to be Low Smoke Zero Halogen Cables (LSZH) and required compliance with BS6701 inferred by BS7671 18th Edition.  They also referenced NGTS 3.24.26 (section 15.1.19 LSZH requirement)  The NGTS was released in April 2021 but the contract was signed in March 2019.  The new requirement was not communicated to the JMS project team.  When looking at the specified NGTS it was referencing other NGTS that has already been archived which also wasn't referenced in Appendix 1.  When looking at the BS Standards referenced in the various NGTS it was found that they had been withdrawn in 2000 and 2009.  It is important that before work starts that if any specified NGTS is referenced is archived, communications and clarity is requested by the NG team to ensure clear understanding of actual requirements. 

"
"During the close out process of legacy NCR's in the Alcumus tool it was observed that sub-contractor correspondence surrounding the NCR's communicated through the Aconex tool had not been closed out on the system.

Go/No-Go check lists for high risk activities. Engineering and Construction lists highlighting requirements to proceed.
It was found that the project did not have an Equipment co-ordinator identified. It is important that the project reviews the org chart and work with the project manager to identify that person through formal communication and acceptance then update the org chart clearly identifying who that person is.
"Generally personnel are not aware that the NGTS prescribe the surveillance criteria for Inspection activities, it seems to be the ""norm"" to give ITP's to Client to populate there own Hold & Witness points, this can lead to extra cost and schedule slip."

"Murphy subcontracted AMS trenchless specialists for the Horizontal directional drilling scope of the progress power limited project to install a Polyethylene HV duct where AMS would be welding the ductings. 
Murphy opted to undertake the testing of the welded ducts. This partially shifted the liability of the quality of the welds from the subcontractor's side. Going forward, Murphy should risk assess and understand what liabilities they would be taking in their contractual agreements before signing-off contracts/Purchase Orders."
"Control of Sub-Contractors:
Parts of Sellindge Project were sub-contracted out by JMS to MIL & MTS who in turn sub-contracted out to several contractors who in turn sub-contracted out other contractors, this made it almost impossible to control the scopes of work due to lack of infrastructure and competent personnel."
"Commissioning - Client operatives to be fully conversant and confident in the operation of fitted equipment and to be able to self diagnose faults.

Impact on Project - Additional costs and delays to arrange product specialists for on site call outs. "
"Operational Drawings not reflecting the reality of what's installed at site.
On several work packages Premtech have developed their designs using a point cloud from a laser scan without checking the elevation details on site. This has led to several work packages where the supports proposed in the design have had to be modified at site to get them to fit. This first occurred in June 2021, but its now been noted that these issues affect multiple work packages so there is an error in the design process somewhere as the 3D model that the designs are based off does not reflect reality of what is at site.
Remedial Action; Surveys to be carried out early with onsite verification.
Project Impact ; This will always effect the G35 detailed programme approval."
"The project has almost completed which means most of the equipment, offices and printers/scanners have been moved off site.  There are some records and ITP's has not all been scanned for safe keeping to the f:/. It is important that important records/documents scanning is completed before the equipment leaves site.  The risk with taking the folders to offices to scan means that important information like ITP and records can get lost with the traveling or even if an accident occurs.  Once these important records/documents gone missing it is hard to provide evidence that the work was completed to the required standard which could lead to the Employer refusing payment as the documents could be part of the handover phase."
"Due to the aggressive nature of the schedule it was requested by Client that the MTS scope should be executed against preliminary  drawing not drawings issued for construction, not only does this add a huge risk to the Project it also makes processing the handover documentation difficult."
"It was highlighted during March's monthly QSI that there wasn't a formal appointment of a TWC / DTWC on the project, steps were initiated to rectify this by either formalising the appointment of the personnel who were carrying out the role at the time, or move personnel from another project to cover the role.
During the Group Lessons Learned audit in May it was highlighted that the appointment still had not been covered, there had been a gap from December 2022 to present where the project did not have a formally appointed TWC / DTWC."
It was found on more than one occasion that when new employees start within the business they are asked to step into a role without being provided the correct training on what their responsibilities are or where to find the processes that needs to be followed.  When a new employees start within the company or project it is important the line manager takes the time to provide process training.  The new employee must understand what their duties and responsibilities are and it's the Line managers responsibility to ensure the information is provided with clear instructions and guidelines.  Which processes are important to their role.
The process requires the project to Appoint a suitably qualified Document Controller to undertake Document Control responsibilities. This information must be captured on a Document Control Competency Matrix.  Before the project starts it's important to conduct the appropriate competency review and complete the records for all employees on the project and store the records in the correct folder for future review.
"Having a line on the Inspection & Test Plan (ITP) for Stamped ""As Built"" drawing has hindered the timely closeout of the ITP folders, this is due to the As Builts not being available at the time of completion of works.
Suggestion is to remove the line on future ITPs and include the As Builts in the design pack managed by the Design Co-Ordinator."
"While auditing the Peterborough and Huntingdon project on Calibration and Maintenance of test and measuring equipment, it was discovered that the Equipment coordinator is not aware of Murphy's responsibility as the main contractor in ensuring that all equipment of subcontractors is in calibration and fit for purpose.

When using Cat & Genny Equipment and to drive the best form of underground service investigation, ensure that the detection area is clear of any surface metal that could cause signal interference, e.g. Pipework, Heras Fencing, ground spikes, etc, as this can generate a false reading.
Good Practice is to track outwards from a known location to the detection area under investigation in order to locate any unknown underground cables and pipes. "
"Early engagement with Design Vendors. Murphy Engineering team and Management increased presence in design meetings and offices. This assisted in identifying technical blockers early, allowing for coordinating resolution as a WSP/Murphy team."
"Changes to specifications not submitted to Suppliers, causing clashing with supplied product and specified requirements. The specification for structural steel required execution class 3 to be applied to steel fabrication. It was discovered that the execution class 3 requirement was over engineered for the application of the steel. However the specification was not shared with the vendor, so no TQ was raised and on verification, it was found that the execution class applied was not the same as within the specification. "
"At the start of the project during compilation of ITT's and contracts with suppliers, some crucial requirements from the Schedules had not been included in the contract with suppliers. This was identified as an challenge after numerous suppliers had been onboarded and when trying to enforce clauses from our schedules i.e 10 day notification of inspection and acceptance of ITP's prior to commencement of manufacture, these requirement had not been communicated to the sub-contractors. Subsequent to this KOM have been arranged to ensure all requirements are included within ITT's and contracts. "
"The Drax Operations, commercial, and Procurement Teams have maintained an open and honest communication through various internal meetings and collaborations and this has led to trust in the Team. It facilitated seamless management of issues and encouraged transparency on the project."
Old rates were used in tendering as against the current market rates on one of the tenders on the project. The latest rates need to be made available to the tendering Team and a second checker to be put in place as gatekeeper before tenders are formally released.
The project delivery Team had issues with IFC drawings not having enough or not detailed enough. Designers to ensure competent reviewers are in place to undertake detailed review of drawings prior to being IFC'd. 
"There appears to be some gap between the preliminary date used by the Designers and the actual realities on site.  In view of this, designers need to undertake a site visit/tour to finalize designs so that their design output will be more accurate and reflect site's current realities."
"It is important to undertake a thorough and detailed review of the construction processes, sequence, buildability, and cost implications before deciding whether to opt for a precast concrete solution on projects. By doing this, time and resources would be optimally used in the delivery of the work scope."
"Murphy has in one way or the other relied on the subcontractor's reports/declaration on the assessment of plants and equipment brought to the site. This has proven to come with its own risk as the breakdown or failure of such subcontractors' equipment doesn't only affect the subcontractor but Murphy's programme, health&safety of their staff, and reputation. Murphy might need to assess subcontractors' plants and equipment before they start operation."

"During an exercise to closeout legacy NCRs / Audit Actions on B&R it was noticed that on occasion we are not very concise with our language surrounding what the action is, with phrases like ""the auditee may consider"", ""It may be an idea too"" This makes action closeouts difficult.

This has been observed this across other projects too.

Going forward we need to make sure when raising actions we verbally agree the action with the actionee and ensure we are concise in the narrative as to what the action is."
"During an audit of Control of Non-Conformances it was noted that many had overdue actions, a contributing factor to this is unrealistic “due dates” for CAPA are entered into the NCR when actions are being raised.

"For future piling rig deliveries, if the rig is required to track on a road, a sufficient number of tracking boards must be used "
AT Route/Sandford compound too small.  Better forward planning regarding amount of area required for storage of materials/plant.  The area became congested during cable drum storage resulting in congested area for plant movements.  No programme impact - but congestion caused issues during peak activities May-August 22.
Cable drums required reducers to be manufactured to enable compatibility with CD700.  Bespoke manufactured spindle would have made this easier.  Manufacturing lead time vs programme did not allow for spindle to be designed and manufactured.  Lessons learnt for Crooks Marsh to review as 18no drums will be installed.  No impact on programme / cost.  Reducers difficult to install as minimal space between reducer and jaw of CD700.
Road crossings - Siemens Road at Road Crossing 1 and 2.  Ducting for road crossings not specified in enough detail for Siemens subcontractor - end points. This meant connection tie in was difficult.  These road crossings were installed by Siemens subcontractor ACS.
"Ducting works CH280-350.  Due to combined trench, trench boxes were required as there was not adequate space to store spoil adjacent to trench and undertake safe open cut.  This slowed down productivity and was not allowed for by site team.  Productivity - 2 days; additional trench boxes required.  Additional subsoil removal/dust."
Topsoil between CH200-600.  Siemens topsoiled between CH200-600.  Top soiling was undertaken to the wrong level which meant JMS had to carry out re-grading works prior to ducting. Top soiling works should have been left until ducting had been completed to save the task being carried out twice by 2no separate contractors - both Siemens and JMS.  Inefficiency for Sandford/AT Route schemes.
landowner relationships.  JMS Agricultural Liaison Officer has engaged and built up a good relationship with stakeholders/ agents/ landowners which has allowed reinstatement works to be undertaken on programme.  Positive impact.
Importing topsoil - Topsoil OHL haul road - AT30-AT33.  No allowance or forward planning in place for bringing in topsoil prior to requirement.  Standby source for topsoil should be confirmed prior to reinstatement as compliance procedure caused a delay to reinstatement works on OHL haul road.
Additional trial holes - services CH200-600 including earth mat in substation.  Services were not always located as per the services drawing received from Siemens resulting in additional trial holes by JMS.
"AT33 wrong tower used on design drawings.  WPD tower subcontractor had not been appointed during JMS design phase.  No design follow up was completed which led to issues not being incorporated into the final tower WPD assured design.  Design Interface timeline to be established for projects of a long nature with numerous interfaces.  Interface issues: cable/ ducting drawing did not align with cable ladders; scaffold design was not compatible with actual tower which caused rework for TWC; link box fixing positions not incorporated into tower build subcontractor design requiring additional materials to be procures/onsite drilling; bonding lead clashes with tower structural metalwork, no allowance for fixing bonding lead to cable ladders."
AT33 incorrect cleats specified.  Incorrect cleats procured due to error on IFC drawing detailing the incorrect cleat.  Additional training required for Arup regarding WPD specification.  Additional design verification hold points to be incorporated.  Reduced clearance subsequently between cable and tower ladder metalwork. 
Temporary works - AT33 cable ladders.  Removal of cable ladders steel members during cable install.  Members of cable install team removed steel members with consultation with Norpower/WPD.  In future prior agreement required from all parties involved.
AT33 - engineers to survey plinth / CSE tower platform as soon as access is available.  This is especially prudent when working on a previous contractors work.  During cable install it was identified that the CSE platform was out of level.  Termination plinth was up to 30mm out of level.  Resulting in standing time during AT33 scaffold install.
132kV CSE structures - required additional rework/ additional materials.  Holes required tapping on site for high frequency earth connections.  Lessons learnt for straight bolted connection in future.  Inadequate fixing positions for bonding lead connection to link box.  Design to incorporate additional fixing points in future structures.
Efficient cable pull - additional lubrication pits.  Additional lubrication pits were installed which helped the cable pull by reducing pulling tensions.  The lesson learnt from this was that the 150-150-150 equal T was more robust than the previously used 50mm (non-equal T).  This removed the risk of damage to the T which could have caused debris entering the cable duct.
"CDM handover / field earths / quality documentation  (especially at HV test) - clear communication regarding the transfer of CDM areas including earthing requirements on items being transferred.  In future projects, a clear outlined plan needs to be agreed by all contractors regarding the transfer of CDM areas with associated earthing schedules which is managed by the client.  Formal CDM quality documentation needs to be agreed during CDM handover so that all parties are content with the quality of the item being transferred."
"Positive Feedback - Welding - Plant 1 Aftercooler Bank installation and welding programme was carried out without incident. This was due to an agreed work scope to counter the manifold deflection which required detailed inspection, welding procedure, lifting plan, correct equipment, competent people, supply chain and all carried out with a comprehensive works briefing completing the work right first time."
"Supplier Support, Positive Feedback - Duvine Ltd attended site to carry out equipment Pre-commissioning checks which were carried out successfully to support the advance of the RE18 acceptance of the Cathodic Protection Programme. There have been many positive benefits in having the equipment manufacturer on site to carry out Pre-Sat communication signal configuration checks between the kiosks and the controller unit. Some minor issues were able to be overcome and signed off without having to plan future visits.  "
"Its been highlighted during the closeout of the Project that the MDR has not been maintained as it should, primarily surrounding ITPs and RAMS, this seems mainly due to the ITPs and RAMs being reviewed and approved/accepted locally by all parties on-site and not following the Document Control process, this was highlighted in an audit carried out in Jan-23, now trying to close out the findings is proving problematic as the DC has no traceability of the documents and is reluctant to amend the MDR to capture the documents as they feel it would be masking a bigger problem of not following process.

"
"During a meeting to review the site establishment ITP it was highlighted that the majority of the personnel on the call did not have access nor know where to access  National Grid Technical Specifications, British Standards, or Inspection Checklist templates.
"
"During the erection of the steelworks for the Sellindge Sub-station an an issue was highlighted surrounding the positioning of gusset plates, further investigation into the problem it was observed that the marking system on the steelwork had been obscured by the galvanising process, resulting in the team not being able to determine whether the incorrect positioning was down to the manufacturing or installation of the plates.

The best practice would be to tag the steelwork with information rather than etching."
"Monthly QSI Report Monitoring LL Observation:
St Fergus MDR doesn’t match or reflect the numbered Method Statements written which is now up to MUR-GNC003419-CN-MS-0205.
Continued register monitoring must be be maintained to ensure effective controls over RAMS Approval and Permit issuing to work packs.
There is an agreed walk through between JMS and NGT which speeds up the approval process but falls short of completing the transmittal for Client DRS Signoff Approval. 
Efforts for site control of the RAMs Register and MDR Records must be maintained by the relevant disciplines.
Reminder for this has been highlighted through the importance of regular Monthly QSI Report and monitoring of project processes. "
"Methods to maintain the control and return of completed approved RLMU Drawings and DRS client approval prior to transmittal to document control. 
Acknowledge there is a requirement to maintain correct document transmittal traceability and to put in place a ‘Local Agreed Practice’ to facilitate the manual transfer of drawing documents at site level. Agreed controls have now been put in place within the JMS Engineering, Terminal Operations and Client Office. 

The 1002-00572 - St Fergus Engineering Register MUST record the receipt dates of any drawings that have been received to maintain oversight and internal traceability."
"During piling conducted by MGE the concrete used for the piles resulted in numerous cubes failing 28 day strength parameter. A full investigation was undertaken by Holland and Holland as well as Mark Culbert from MAE, it was identified that due to the hostile environment that GGBS was used in the concrete mix. GGBS has a slower curing rate but ultimately obtains greater strength than other concrete mixes. A TQ was raised and a request to change the mix to C30/37 (<33N/mm2) compressive strength due to the GGBS factor. Adapting the parameters to align to C30/37 (<33N/mm2) compressive strength it was found that the samples had in fact passed. It is important to acknowledge the curing rate of GGBS on future projects with understanding that is likely only to reach strength after 56 days and to plan around the extended timeframe."
"Designers responsible for a multifaceted(Involving Civil, EC&I, Mechanical, etc) scope of work must collaborate effectively and adhere to the project's schedule in order to achieve precise and resilient designs. Construction drawings should be thoroughly examined and approved by all disciplines involved in the design before they are released for utilization by the construction team or third-party fabricators/manufacturers."
"Remember to adhere to all mandatory site rules, no personnel transmitting devices allowed on site, hand in at the security entrance point. Complacency of COMAH Site Rules and Regulations not being followed, bringing a mobile phone on to site and witnessed taking a call by a works vehicle. This is in breach of site rules and the message given at the site induction stage. Incident to be resolved via company HSEQ and likely operative redeployment."
"Bases in poor ground - VT bases installed in poor ground conditions moved during excavations around them, causing delays & cost to restore the ground - Temporary works to be more detailed & more conservative shared with full team."
"Control of Supply Chain:
Some of the supply chain, or their partners did not have adequate supervision and management of the works.  This resulted in an array of issues that would include but not be limited too, Poor housekeeping, failure to report damage to plant and equipment. H&S breaches, poor quality, poor time keeping.

Suggestions to aviod re-occurrence on future Projects:
JMS to ensure that the supply chain is adequately supervised by a nominated member of the JMS team who will monitor the personnel, progress, safety, and quality and that this is clearly reported.
Hub days for Sub-contractors and refresher courses for Murphy personnel
"
"Improved cost control:
Less use of P Cards and more use of requisitions filed along with delivery notes- leaves it easier for record keeping.  Many last-minute changes due to design change etcetera required items to be purchased quickly.  Procurement/plant hire to react quicker to change, improved forward planning of requirements.

Suggestions to avoid re-occurrence on future projects:
Brief teams that P Card only to be used in emergency situations. 
Requisitions are more efficient, easier to trace and give more opportunity for cost savings during quotation.
"
"Engineering team not understanding their role in quality control:
Not all Engineers clearly understood their role in quality control and how to progress through the construction process using an ITP.  Lack of quality audits allowed this to continue leading to major quality issues.

Suggestions to avoid re-occurrence on future Projects:
Ensure that there are sufficient and competent staff managing quality control."
"As-built drawings and other handover documents:
Many of the as-built documents were not completed in a timely manner nor were they of the required standard.  As-built documentation should be produced as the project progresses and not left until the end. Ensure the project retains the right resources to complete this.  Improvements need to be made to the design and document control management.

Suggestions to avoid re-Occurrence on future Projects:
Ensure as built and other handover documents are completed in a timely manner throughout the build.  Regular audits to ensure this is taking place.  Improve document control with the use of suitable apps."
"UKCA / CE directives requires the (Manufacturer) to provide certificate of conformity for assemblies containing multiple pieces of equipment and machinery that contribute to the complete system. The manufacturer under these directives may be one of the manufacturers providing the equipment  , the assembler of the equipment, the operator or owner of the equipment and / or  EPC contractor. The overall responsible party and the battery limits between manufacturers, assemblers / EPC contractor and or owner / operator of equipment should be clearly defined within the contract. The commercial contract between manufacturers, JMS, GLNG should confirm who holds responsibility for what, under each piece of legislation and who’s is being considered as the legal manufacturer. There is significant risk and cost when acting as legal manufacturer, due to these battery limits and responsibilities not being clearly defined there is ambiguity as to who is ultimately responsible for provision of certificate of conformity for the final assembly. This ambiguity has led to increased cost, time and disagreement between all parties involved.

"On inspection of suction pots that were moved from outside storage to indoor storage based on the recommendation by Nikkiso that outside storage was not recommended for a period exceeding 6 months. It was discovered during inspection that significant corrosion had occurred to the temporary bolts and had subsequently stained the flanges the bottom flange and plate edge. The materials used for the temporary bolts  was not of sufficient material causing cross contamination. On investigation the requirements of temporary materials are not specified. In order to prevent the cost and time to rectify the corrosion and staining, temporary materials that have the potential to contaminate or degrade should not be used on products. Specifications should include instruction to use temporary components suitable for the environment they are being placed / stored in and which do not pose risk of contamination of the product.   "
"During an audit of the control of non-conformances, it was highlighted that actions were being raised in Alcumus which contained multiple action bullet points, which makes it difficult to close the overreaching action out in a timely manner.
"
"Project Management:
Changes were made to the project management team that left the project at risk due to mandatory appointments not being re-assigned.

Recommendations:
 - Ensure handover is planned and completed with the handover of responsibilities clearly defined.
 - Ensure any mandatory appointments (TWC, TWS etc.) held by the outgoing members of the project team are re-assigned to competent personnel..
"
"Changes to key members of the project management team:

Members of the project management team left the project without a suitable replacement; this laid a great burden on those that had to pick up these roles and responsibilities.  Both the environmental management and quality management was left under resourced, this also put additional pressures on the personnel left on the Project.  
The environmental side added pressure to an already stretched H&S department.  
The resource issue caused  quality issues resulting in prolongation of the works.

Recommendations:

 - Project Management should ensure a full hand over of roles and responsibilities are completed and that those taking on these roles have both the competence to carryout the role and the time to complete the additional tasks.

"
"Supervision of complex Sub-Contracts

It was clearly evident that complex sub-contracts (Steelworks, scaffolding etc...) did not have sufficient supervision to monitor and control their supply chain in all aspects of their works  and reporting.

Recommendations:
 - Ensure that we have an independent SME monitoring the works of the more complex supply chain.
"
"Clear reporting of cost associated with NCR’s:

If the total costs of an NCR were clearly reported it would make people think a lot more about doing it right first time.  The manual system of allocating hours and associated cost associated to Project did not always capture the full cost of the NCR due to poor record keeping.  The Alcumus system RCA tab calls for actual costs and hours, currently we seem to put a “finger in the air” and guess this, ultimately giving the business a false figure for COPQ.

Recommendations:
 - Projects need to start recording associated costs i.e., materials, hours etc more accurately.
 - Training for key personnel in Alcumus & EcoOnline.  
 - A graduate QS on site 70% of the day recording the various trades activities would ultimately pay for itself.
"
"Improved automation of record keeping:
The Arora system only recorded the on/off site times at the project office, it could not be used to track people on or off site.  A sign in and out system was adopted but this was flawed, some people were not following the procedure.  This resulted in poor record keeping and distrust by the client.  

Recommendations:
 - The Arora system is a great addition to the business for record keeping but needs to be implemented properly. We should ensure all of the supply chain use this.
We need to look into streamlining this process and how it can be automated. Access control, electronically logged to allow ease of review.

 - QR codes could be used to identify areas that the various teams were working.  Individuals could scan the code with their phone and their location could be mapped.  Electronic mapping could be complete using Itemit or something more complex.
"
"Improvement needed on record keeping:
The manual completion of allocation sheets is time consuming and inconsistent among the teams of both JMS and the supply chain.  This applies to hours worked, work progress and allocated plant.


Recommendations:
 - Utilise apps for supervisors to complete shift reports and allocation sheets. 
 - Commercial team to have workshop with supervisors at start of projects to brief requirements and monitor as project progresses.
"
"Appointment of personnel through agency:
It became apparent that certain agency individuals were on hyper inflated rates of pay.

Recommendations:
 - Ensure market rates are paid with no appointments made without justification to inflated rates.  This includes appointments made by the supply chain.
"
"Engineering team not adequately supported:
Engineers new to the business and not knowing the systems were left un-checked.


Recommendations:
 - Ensure Engineers new to the business clearly understand the full extent of their roles and responsibilities and that they are guided and supported."
"Failure to comply with the clients TP135 specification: 
The standard of many of the as-built drawings did not meet the clients specifications prolongating the as-built process.

Recommendations:
 - Ensure that the drawing templates of both JMS and its supply chain are following the specification and approved by the client prior to the production of red-line and as-built drawings.
"
"Incomplete design solutions by the client:
The drip feeding of design  by the client caused production delays.

Recommendations:
Client should have allowed more time for design to ensure smooth flow of construction."
"Delays to the production of hand-over documents:

The demobilisation of the site offices during the handover phase was a mistake.  The control of the project documentation and the fragmentation of the delivery team caused delays in completing the handover documents.  it was highlighted that most of the inspection check sheets / site documentation were hard copies only, due to the site being demobilised at short notice the binders containing the documentation were boxed and transported to several different locations, this made it very difficult to collate the handover documentation.

Recommendations:
 - On new projects implement Aconex Field or some similar system.
 - On existing projects ensure site documentation / records are digitised as you progress and uploaded to the project hub in a timely manner.

"
"Storage of site documentation:
During the review / alignment of the handover documentation (ITP check sheets) it was highlighted that some personnel are saving scanned documents locally on their  Laptops rather than on the Project Hub.  This left the project at risk of losing this information if the laptop was lost or persons left the business.

Recommendations:
 - All site documentation / records need to be saved on the Project hub.
 - The use of One Note for personnel diaries may be an option these would also need to be stored/shared on the Project Hub. 
"
"Clear understanding of clients’ specification:
Generally, personnel are not aware that the NGTS 3.10.00 prescribes the surveillance criteria for Inspection activities, it seems to be the ""norm"" to give ITPs to Client to populate their own Hold & Witness points, this can lead to extra cost and schedule slip.
The majority of ITPs were authored, reviewed and approved / accepted locally on-site without going through the formal internal review / approval process and DCC

Recommendations:
 - ITP’s need to be authored in line with the technical specifications.
 - ITP's should be authored reviewed and approved internally before going formally to Client via DCC.

"
"Due to the aggressive nature of the schedule, it was requested by Client that the MTS scope should be executed against preliminary drawings not drawings issued for construction, not only does this add a huge risk to the Project it also makes processing the handover documentation difficult.

Recommendations:
 - Drawing release process needs to be adhered too. 
 - “Press Pause” should have been adopted."
"Prompt close out of audit actions regarding formal appointments:
It was highlighted during the March 23 monthly QSI that there wasn’t a formal appointment of a TWC / DTWC on the project, steps were initiated to rectify this by either formalising the appointment of the personnel who were carrying out the role at the time or move personnel from another project to cover the role.
During the Group Lessons Learned audit in May it was highlighted that the appointment still had not been covered, there had been a gap from December 2022 to present where the project did not have a formally appointed TWC / DTWC.

Recommendations:
 - Ensure formal appointments are in place before SoW. 
 - The appointments should also be highlighted on the Org chart and listed in the Construction Phase Plan.
"
"Close out of ITP’s:  
Having a line on the Inspection & Test Plan (ITP) for stamped ""As Built” drawing has hindered the timely closeout of the ITP folders; this is due to the As Built not being available at the time of completion of works.

Recommendations:
Remove the line on future ITPs and include the “As Built” in the design pack managed by the Design Co-Ordinator."
"Incorrect design solution:
Design from subcontractor COLT was highlighted as being incorrect, MTS challenged this and had design changed.

Lesson Learned:
Do not be afraid to challenge the design (4no. cables / actuator when only 2 were necessary MTS have the technical know-how to change contractors/suppliers)."
"Failure of client to maintain the project 3D Model:
The model and drawings did not match site conditions on several occasions. Both the existing structures and below ground conditions.  

Recommendations:
 - Complete accurate above and below ground surveys  before design begins. 
 - LIDAR could be utilised?"
"Failure by client to manage the CDM areas:  
Due to the aggressive and congested nature of the schedule, works were undertaken out of the standard and recommended order, this led to damage and rework. For example, the doors and sections of floors.  Constantly changing of CDM responsibilities and work areas caused confusion.


Recommendation(s):
 - More detailed inspection reports, pictures, and signoff by all parties in a timely manner.
 - Adopt the ""Press Pause"" process when installations are not as per ITP."
"Miss-management of plant and equipment:
 - Damaged plant, multiple contractors employed by JMS using each other's equipment, this led to there being no traceability of damages.
 - No trace of daily inspections being carried out in compliance with the PUWER regulation. Poor record keeping.
 - No pictorial evidence on what was hired/off hired.  This led to incomplete items being returned thus incurring additional collection charges.
 - Not all collections were closely supervised resulting in reports of missing items incurring additional charges.

Recommendation(s):
 - The use of plant tracking app should be used like ITEMIT.  This would allow operators/supervisors to take pictures as a record of condition when they used it. This takes seconds to do this task. Benefits would be: 1. accountability, 2. report damage to allow repairs to be carried out. 3. track servicing, 4. PUWER compliance.

"
"Small power tools being lost or stolen:
Once small tools were signed out of the stores, there was no periodic checks to locate and inspect equipment.  Tools being used by multiple trades with no clear responsible person.

Recommendation(s):
 - The use of electronic tagging system ITEMIT the user scans the equipment with their smartphone when taken from the stores then daily after his pre-use checks.  Easy to identify the last user and where it was used.
"
"Maintenance of Plat Hire Register:
Equipment not being removed from the hire list. Not adequately controlling the on / off hire of equipment, not taking records of condition and number of parts or accessories.  

Recommendation(s):
 - Maintenance of the plant hire list is crucial to maintain the cost control of plant.  
 - Ensure all items relating to the off hire are collected allowing it to be removed from hire list.  
 - Report lost or stolen equipment, allowing this to be removed from the asset list.
 - Apply constant pressure on to MPL to ensure they are managing their side of the on/off hire lists.
 - Ensure off hired equipment is collected in a timely manner.
"
"Client continually changing CDM areas and the responsibility of these areas:
These changes made it hard to manage areas correctly.  First aid, fire and spill control moving around all of the time.  People unaware of what areas to inspect.

Recommendation(s):
 - Ensure CDM regulations are adhered too.
 - Where necessary implement the ""Press Pause"" process.
"
"Quality Control:
QC was removed from site in Aug / Sep of 2022, resulting in on-site inspections ceasing, subsequently the project has had a major issue with non-compliant brickwork on the stairwells which would have potentially been picked up if QC had been present.

Recommendation(s):
 - Ensure competent personnel are retained for the full duration of the Project."
"Management of physical ITP folders:
Handover folders were misplaced on more than one occasion, mainly due to the short notice of site de-mobilisation, folders were boxed and sent to several different locations.

Recommendation(s)
 - Use of digital technology (Aconex Field) to negate the need for hard copies.
 - Implement sign over document to record the location of each folder
 - Digitise the documentation as an on-going activity.
"
"Inconsistent shift patters and breaks:
Sub-Contractor employed by JMS, or the supply chain MIL and MTS were all working different shifts and break times.  This caused issues managing their breaks to determine who was on a genuine break and who was idling and who should be going home at what time, this culminated in significant lost hours

Recommendation(s):
 - Supply chain need to improve the management of their working parties, ensure that break times were maintained and that they delivered their works in a timely manner."
"Program management:
The clients build program placed undue stress on the project team.  This led to many construction issues.

Recommendation(s):
 - Going forward JMS should challenge unrealistic programs and adopt the ""Press Pause"" process.
 -
"
"Actuator Supplier – For future build works, witnessing of the build process as well as a specified oil cleanliness level at contract to be set. Clean build programme and specifications required. Recommendation of Improvements have come about from recent equipment defects register and NCRs raised on the project equipment supplier."
"Compound set up for storage and materials, improved materials management and preservation. Investigate expanding existing habitats and workshops to increase the weather protection for equipment requiring strip down and inspection within the compound, reducing transportation costs."
Conducting a route survey with the assistance of Google Maps should be complemented by physically walking along the pipeline route. This would ensure that real and actual physical features are identified and taken into consideration in the design and overall feasibility of the project.
"Implementing a more thorough preconstruction review for construction drawings, documents, and work sequence is crucial before commencing actual construction on the site. This approach ensures the identification and resolution of errors and issues prior to resource mobilization, optimizing time and resources and ultimately leading to cost and time savings in the long run.

There were issues identified with drawings and materials at the actual site of construction which could have been identified by undertaking a more robust desktop review of documents."
"A thorough examination of materials received from an external supplier for subsequent processes, such as welding, must be conducted before commencing work. 

This precautionary measure aims to prevent any potential liabilities on Murphy in the event that defects in the material or equipment become apparent in the future."
"The client has outlined specific requirements for handover documents, which the project team was unaware of. The National Grid Specification ""Project Health and Safety File and Supporting Handover Records-NGUK/Con/BP007G Issue 15 January 2017"" specifies that records should be presented in a standard orientation, eliminating the need for additional efforts to rotate for viewing. Unfortunately, many individuals on the project were unaware of this requirement and scanned documents in orientations that did not comply with the standard. Extra efforts and resources had to be allocated to fixing the issue."
"It was observed during the QSI that although formal appointments for TWC / TWS had been generated and signed off by the appropriate line manager, on 2 occasions the appointment had not been signed as accepted by the individual undertaking the position."
"After unseasonal rainfall, flooding was experienced at the bell mouth (AC159) entrance to Mobilisation Site 2.
It was found that the new tarmac had sunk in the middle of the road of Bushy Common Lane forming a slight V shape. This had stopped the waters ability to run off the road.
Root Cause Analysis found the cause to be that heavy plant machinery were entering and exiting on the same point of the road causing the tarmac to squash.
Specifications for The Openings Of Highways S2.2.4 - Surface Depression Intervention limit reached - we exceeded the 1m^2 limit
The plan is to plain off the top and recourse the tarmac - Plainer was Unserviceable before Christmas - waiting for NW Surfacing to say when they can do it."
"When using cement grout between curb stones and tarmac, beware of water in the gap. As you apply the grout, the water will come up and stain the tarmac. The completed job would have looked perfect otherwise."
"General Winter Working Controls. Be aware of additional or heightened hazards to be taken into consideration where overnight frost collects around welfare cabins and work areas to ensure and that there is regular maintenance of road ways and walkways. Carryout regular winter safety briefings, check there is an adequate stockpile of grit or salt which is outlined within the project Winterisation Plan. "
Review of Permit Request. It is determined that there is a need to improve the way that approvals are worked through with the client due to recent rejections on minor comments knocked back on RAMs simply to clarify knowledge gaps internally by the project and terminal shift members. Requests that the shift officers also carryout a review of the RAMs as it is noted that they often miss this review opportunity prior to issuing permits.
"When ordering HAM Units for Elstree Project, the VDDR was written by the Project Manager at that time (July 2023). The project was at its start. There was no input from the engineering team on this VDDR. The quality of the VDDR was extremely low. For example, the VDDR was referring to a specification document number of another project (Twinstead Green!). Also many of the cells such as welding or coating documents were ticked which has nothing to do with the HAM Units. Projects must ensure VDDRs are written by someone from the Engineering team which has a technical background. At this moment in time, Elstree project is still the same, Site Manager usually writes the VDDR and send it to Quality for review. Which means technical input from engineering team does not exist at the current VDDRs submitted to Quality team. This is not as per the company procedure. "
"During site establishment, the site engineer created their own primary control points around site.  The ITP requires that suitable primary control is in place prior to works start, and this should be installed either by MAE or Competent Surveying Contractor.  Lesson Learnt is that Site Engineers should never install Primary Control."
"Following delivery of CSE steelwork to site and commencement of cable installation activities, difficulties have been encountered due to availability of space for cable manipulation and routing at member SB03. This member at the top of the CSE structure is welded and fixed in accordance with the NG assured drawing. The structure was built to drawing. To resolve the issue is was agreed (via DCN016) to cut off member SB03, pull the cable into position, and replace member SB03 with a bolted interface instead of welding back into position.
The Lesson Learned is a proposal to use bolted members on structures going forward, where possible, as this design gives flexibility to be able to remove the members if required during cable installations, whereas a welded member does not."
"It was observed during an audit of Temporary works that it seems to be common practice to have templates for permits saved on the Project Hub rather than downloading from MIMS each time to ensure the correct revision is being used, this has also been observed on other projects."
